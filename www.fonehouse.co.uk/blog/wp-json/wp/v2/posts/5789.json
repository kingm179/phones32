With COVID restrictions still in place, it\u2019s not going to be quite the same as usual. In 2020, they actually cancelled the event!<\/p>\n<h2>What is MWC?<\/h2>\n<p>So, what is MWC? MWC stands for Mobile World Congress. This is an event that takes place every single year and it\u2019s where we see a lot of the best, most exciting handsets and other tech due to be released for the year. This is the biggest mobile event of the year. In 2020, the event was cancelled due to COVID however, it\u2019s still going ahead in 2021. The cancellation previously saw a few exciting manufacturer events, such as the Sony release, taking place online. This is where we got all our information for releases due to come in 2020.<\/p>\n<h2>When does it take place?<\/h2>\n<p>Usually, MWC takes place in March. This year, we\u2019ve seen it delayed to June 28th, lasting until July 1st. This event has been pushed back with hopes to keep its plans in place.&nbsp; Event organisers are hoping that different members of the tech community will be able to attend with the ease of restrictions expected. If it goes ahead, MWC 2021 will be held in Barcelona with a number of different online features. This is where the event is held each year.<\/p>\n<h2>What can we expect from Sony?<\/h2>\n<p>Usually, Sony takes this exciting event and announces the release of their flagship devices for the rest of the year. 2019 saw them announce the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/sony-xperia-1\\\">Sony Xperia 1<\/a>. Just last year, they announced the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/sony-xperia-1-ii\\\">Xperia 1 II<\/a> through their own online event. Could this potentially mean we\u2019ll be getting a mark three in 2021? So far, Sony haven\u2019t released any hints or confirmed any details as to what we can expect from them in 2021. We can work out that it\u2019s highly likely we\u2019ll see them announce a release for the third or fourth quarter of the year at the event.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Huawei?<\/h2>\n<p>Huawei usually save their flagship devices for their own release event. That doesn\u2019t mean that they don\u2019t bring anything exciting to the table at the MWC events though! We usually see a new Huawei tech product, whether it\u2019s a laptop or headphones. We would expect for Huawei to continue this streak and announce another tech product to add to the list, perhaps a new smartwatch. It\u2019s also likely that they\u2019re announce a few predecessor handsets at the event. We could see an improved foldable device or even just a new Mate addition.<\/p>\n<h2>More Manufacturers&nbsp;<\/h2>\n<p>Nokia is one mobile phone manufacturer that seems to save a lot of their products for the event. In fact, they have one of the biggest presences at MWC. This could also be down to the fact that they offer a huge range of affordable and higher end devices. We would hope to see a new Nokia flagship device released at MWC 2021. It\u2019s also highly likely that we\u2019ll get a few lower specification devices too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Another big name at the event will be LG. Like a number of other brands, they save their flagship announcements for MWC. With that in mind, we\u2019re expecting to see the next flagship LG announcement at the end of July. This is bound to offer a much more affordable device to the market whilst keeping specifications relatively high too.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now you know what to expect from MWC 2021, you\u2019ll want to make sure you tune in.
