If you\u2019re unsure of how that works, then read on as we explain step-by-step how to record what you do with an iPhone 8 Plus.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Screen Recording With Your iPhone 8<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>So, you&#8217;ll be pleased to know that screen recording is not a difficult task. Apple has made it so that if you need to record from your system, you can do it without having to fiddle with a lot of settings. However, it all begins with toggling the function from within your Settings app.<\/p>\n<p>Once you&#8217;ve arrived at the Settings, you&#8217;re going to want to make sure that you go into the Control Center. This will give you the ability to change what features are available to you when you swipe in a particular direction and bring up a menu. You\\&#8217;ll want to find the screen record option and toggle it.<\/p>\n<p>Now you&#8217;re ready to start recording the screen and getting the most out of the system. Swipe from the bottom of the screen with the 8 Plus to activate the screen recording function. You&#8217;ll want to tap on the button which is new to your layout and select the microphone. From there, you&#8217;re going to want to toggle the option to start recording. Remember that there is a countdown, and then the phone begins tracking your movements and inputs. It&#8217;s three seconds, so you&#8217;ve got time to think about what you want to do.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Restrictions and Stopping\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s so important to realise that there can be restrictions when it comes to your recording. Some applications don&#8217;t allow audio to be captured &#8211; that&#8217;s not something you can do anything about and isn&#8217;t a technical issue.<\/p>\n<p>It is also wise to note that when you want to stop, you&#8217;ll want to tap the status bar at the top of your screen. Otherwise, you&#8217;ll keep recording forever, which is something to avoid!<\/p>\n<p>So as you can see, it&#8217;s not difficult to record footage on an iPhone 8 Plus. It&#8217;s handy for creating tutorials and showing people exactly what they need to do to unlock a specific feature.<\/p>\n<p>Whatever you choose to record on the phone, remember that you&#8217;ve got that countdown to keep in mind. It&#8217;s essential when you&#8217;re trying to avoid making mistakes with your recording and to make sure that no part of the process is left out. Apple has gone to a lot of trouble to make sure that people can record quickly, and you don&#8217;t have to do anything but make sure that you are ready to record when the timer goes down.<\/p>\n<p>Shop the full range of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\">iPhone mobile deals online<\/a> with Fonehouse now.<\/p>\n<p><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s probably not surprising at this point to hear that the iPhone has a selection of different features designed to make it easier for people to embrace smartphone technology.
