So read on to find the best Sony handset for you if you\u2019re looking to take your smartphone photography to the next level&#8230;<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Sony-Xperia-XZ2-Compact?\\\">Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact<\/a>\u00a0features a 19MP Motion Eye camera which reacts to its surroundings just like the human eye. We were extremely impressed with this camera setup, especially on a compact smartphone,\u00a0 and we\u2019re sure that all of the photography enthusiasts out there will be just as impressed. The XZ2 Compact is also able to record 4K video and super slow motion footage at 960 frames per second in full 1080p HD quality, so whether your taking static shots or making your very first feature film, you\u2019ll always be producing work at a great high standard.<\/p>\n<p>The Sony Xperia XZ2 Compact can be yours for \u00a3493 SIM free or, for a more affordable option, as little as \u00a333 per month on a fantastic Sony pay monthly deal.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Sony Xperia XZ2<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Much like it\u2019s smaller sibling, the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Sony-Xperia-XZ2?\\\">Sony Xperia XZ2<\/a>\u00a0also features an 19MP camera with innovative motion eye technology, meaning that your photos will come out clear, crisp and of an astonishingly high quality in any lighting conditions. If filming is more your cup of tea, Sony have developed the world\\&#8217;s first innovative 4K HDR Video recording technology with the XZ2, meaning that you can capture life\\&#8217;s most important moments in the highest of video quality.<\/p>\n<p>The Sony Xperia XZ2 costs \u00a3685 if you\u2019re looking to buy SIM free, but luckily at Fonehouse you can also get your hands on it for as little as \u00a337 per month.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Sony Xperia XZ Premium<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Sony-Xperia-XZ-Premium?\\\">Sony Xperia XZ Premium<\/a>\u00a0also comes equipped with an impressive 19MP rear camera, and, as expected, uses some of Sony\u2019s latest innovative technology to take your photography to the next level making for a smartphone that is premium in name and premium by nature! Evolved pixels mean that the XZ Premium can capture more detail and light in every shot, even in poor lighting conditions. The Motion Eye Camera that we;ve already mentioned means that your smartphone camera will react to its surroundings just like the human eye. Add to that an innovative memory stacked Exmor RS for mobile sensor to give you premium images, Sony Lens G for higher optical clarity and BIONZ for faster image processing and you are fully equipped with a smartphone camera that won\u2019t ever fail to perform.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Sony Xperia XZ1<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Sony-Xperia-XZ1?\\\">Sony Xperia XZ1<\/a>\u00a0features a 19MP rear camera and once again features the innovative Motion Eye Camera technology to allow your smartphone camera to react to its surroundings just like the human eye (have we said that enough yet?). Add to that memory stacked Exmor RS for mobile sensor to give you premium images, Sony Lens G for higher optical clarity and BIONZ for faster image processing and you\u2019ve got an incredible camera setup contained in a durable and good looking handset. And in case you were worried we\u2019d forgotten about those all important selfies, there\u2019s also a 13MP front facing camera.<\/p>\n<p>SIM free the XZ1 will set you back around \u00a3552, but you can take advantage of one the amazing Sony Xperia XZ1 pay monthly deals that we currently have at Fonehouse, meaning that it could be yours for just \u00a337 per month.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Sony-Xperia-XZ1?\\\">Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact<\/a>\u00a0is very similar to the XZ1 in that it also features a 19MP rear camera with Motion Eye Camera, Exmor RS, Sony Lens G and BIONZ. We don\u2019t need to tell you that all of this contributes to a camera setup that will deliver truly impressive images that will allow you to develop your smartphone photography skills, even if you\u2019re a complete amateur. On top of all of that you also have a 13MP front shooter to play around with and take great quality selfies.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to get hold of the Sony Xperia XZ1 Compact SIM free then it will cost you around \u00a3552. However if you\u2019re on the hunt for an upgrade or pay monthly deal then you can get the XZ1 Compact for as little as \u00a337 per month with nothing to pay upfront.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra is a great smartphone with some impressive internal hardware. Even though this isn\u2019t the most recent release from Sony, the handset still features a mighty 23MP rear camera, powerful enough to rival some of the more high end smartphones available right now. As if that wasn\u2019t enough, on top of all of that the XA2 Ultra also has two selfie cameras; a 16MP set up that will take great selfies even in low lighting conditions, and a fantastic 120 degree super wide angle 8MP camera so you can fit all your friends and family into your selfies.<\/p>\n<p>The XA2 Ultra is reasonably priced at just \u00a3357 SIM free, but is equally great value when you go for an amazing Fonehouse pay monthly deal; it could be yours for just \u00a328 per month &#8211; what a steal!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Sony Xperia XA2<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Sony-Xperia-XA2?\\\">Sony Xperia XA2<\/a>\u00a0features an equally impressive 23MP camera that puts some of the most high end smartphones available today to shame. And, you might have guessed, the XA2 comes with all of those added Sony extras including Exmor RS for mobile sensor and 4K video recording to allow you to record all of your favourite moments in life in amazing quality. As well as that you can take great selfies with an 8MP front facing camera and a 120 degree wide angle lens; with that kind of innovative technology you\u2019ll always be looking your best and those Instagram likes will come flooding in.<\/p>\n<p>If you fancy the Sony Xperia XA2 SIM free then you\u2019ll be looking at paying \u00a3286, but you can also get the XA2 for as little as \u00a323 per month with nothing to pay upfront.<\/p>\n<p>So if you\u2019re on the hunt for a brand new smartphone and Sony is your brand of choice, and if the camera is your priority when buying a new phone, you can rest assured that there are some fantastic mobile phone deals currently available at Fonehouse.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you\u2019re on the hunt for a new smartphone we all know how important it is to get a device that has everything you need;
