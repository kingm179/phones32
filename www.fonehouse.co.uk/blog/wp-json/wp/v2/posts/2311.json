Besides the oversized screen, Galaxy Note 3 revived another forgotten piece of technology; the stylus. This of course was not a classic stylus, but a reincarnation of a higher form achieved by combining new display technologies with advanced software solutions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Note 3 is yet another device from the Galaxy series with traditional Samsung design lines. However, compared to its predecessor as well as other devices in the series, it has less rounded corners and has taken on a more rectangular shape. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What\u2019s interesting is the back cover which raised a large cloud of dust during the phone\u2019s reveal. It was speculated that the back cover would be made out of artificial leather, which was a first in the Smartphone world.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Taking Note 3 out of the box immediately reveals that the artificial leather idea was ditched for a more practical solution. Designers went for a polycarbonate back cover with specially designed texture which looks like leather, but is much more durable than actual leather would be. Dimensions are 151.2 x 79.2 x 8.3 mm and it weighs 168 grams.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Super AMOLED displays have become sort of a trademark on Samsung\\&#8217;s devices and Note 3 follows that tradition. In order to avoid a discussion about which screen technology is better (LCD or OLED), we need to point out that it all comes down to a matter of taste and comparing them is an uphill battle. Fact is that whites look a bit yellowish on AMOLED screens, but that\u2019s the price to pay for higher fidelity darker colors, especially black.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>Screen brightness has been improved as well, giving Note 3 better visibility in direct sunlight. A screen diagonal of 5.7 inches, combined with 1080p resolution grants a screen density of 386ppi, which is above the so-called retina border.<\/p>\n<p>This simply means that there is no chance you\u2019ll spot individual pixels with your naked eye. It should be said that Samsung\\&#8217;s flagship models have an option for adjusting display color, similar to what you\u2019d find on television sets. You can pick from standard, dynamic and film, which can all be adjusted depending on content and lighting conditions.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Samsung Galaxy Note 3<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Note 3 is powered by the latest generation of Qualcomm\u2019s quad-core Snapdragon 800 processor. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">This year\u2019s CPU market is pretty clear cut since Qualcomm dominates as key equipment manufacturer, and topping Snapdragon 800 with its blazing performance seems like mission impossible. Note 3 achieves unbelievable results utilizing all the power from Snapdragon 800, and unlike the competition, it comes with 3GBs of RAM which is a huge chunk by any standard. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Adreno 330 graphic coprocessor delivers 50% better performance over its predecessor, ensuring the best possible experience in all segments including multimedia and demanding gameplay.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The same 13 MP sensor seen on Galaxy S4 has been carried over with virtually identical software. We have no objections since it\u2019s one of the better sensors found in smartphones. You can choose from several modes offering a variety of effects such as combining image and sound, HDR, panorama, drama shot, surround shot (360 degrees image), etc. Colors are accurate, contrast is excellent and the overall impression you get is remarkable.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Galaxy Note 3 is clearly designed for power users which make no compromises. The Snapdragon 800 CPU speaks for itself, while 3GBs of RAM were unprecedented at the time. S Pen has evolved to give users a more refined experience and increased versatility in everyday use. If you\u2019re comfortable with handling such a large device, then there is nothing out there to match its performance.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Few could assume that Galaxy Note would create a whole new market niche, with an expanding number of followers.
