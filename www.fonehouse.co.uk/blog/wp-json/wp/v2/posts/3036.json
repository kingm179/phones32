With contracts of 24 months at a time, it\\&#8217;s not like it comes around very often, but this process is often rushed by people and not thought about as much as it should.<\/p>\n<p>Bearing in mind we use our phones for almost everything these days, you think people would want to put more effort into finding the right one for them. But instead\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/upgrade\\\">upgrades<\/a>\u00a0are often rushed and we are left being, once again, more often than not disappointed after 3 months, realising we still don\\&#8217;t have enough data to last.<\/p>\n<p>The best thing about new and improved smartphones appearing on the market, is that Network Providers are upping the amount of data on tariffs. This is something that\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/upgrade\\\">EE<\/a>\u00a0have down to a T.
