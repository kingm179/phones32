You needed the SIM to be able to get the most from a handset, and you needed the phone itself to contact people. Because of this almost symbiotic relationship, no one challenged the idea that you couldn\\&#8217;t buy a phone without buying a SIM to go with it. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">However, times have changed. With mobile phone contracts and deals currently the standard way to use a phone, people have challenged the status quo. So the question for today is simple. Can you buy a mobile phone without a SIM?<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Why Would You Not Want a SIM?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">With SIM cards being such a standard part of any mobile experience, understanding why you wouldn\\&#8217;t suddenly want one is vital. There\\&#8217;s a couple of different reasons why you might want a mobile phone without a SIM to go with it. First of all, you might already have a SIM with a mobile number and don\\&#8217;t want or need a new one. You fancy getting yourself a new handset though, so that\\&#8217;s all you set out to acquire.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Alternatively, you might not need a SIM. The modern smartphone is capable of many things and can serve as a portable tablet or computer for many people. The SIM is sometimes surplus to requirement &#8211; all many people need is an internet connection to go online, check emails, run a business and keep up with friends.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>What Limitations Exist Without a SIM?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">While you can buy mobile phones without a SIM, you will find that there limitations on what you can and cannot do with your device. Understandably, you won\\&#8217;t be able to make or receive calls and text messages. These are things you can only do with a network connection, and you don\\&#8217;t have that without a SIM. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Furthermore, you won\\&#8217;t be able to get any of the various contracts and deals that we offer! Because a handset can be replaced and changed, many people find that the commitment they have is tied directly to the SIM card itself. Without it, you can\\&#8217;t access any of the benefits such as free calls, texts or the free perks offered by the network providers. You also cannot turn your phone into a portable wifi hotspot either, because it doesn\\&#8217;t have a source of independent data. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Overall, you can <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/sim-free-phones\\\">buy a mobile phone without a SIM<\/a> to go with it. However, you need to understand that there are pros and cons to this. If you\\&#8217;re someone who\\&#8217;s going to put a pre-existing SIM into the phone, then you\\&#8217;re in luck. However, if you\\&#8217;re someone who wants to be able to get access to a free provision of texts and calls, you may find that this isn\\&#8217;t possible without a contract. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">These <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\\\">mobile phone deals<\/a> are tied to the SIM itself. It\\&#8217;s vital to assess your needs when you\\&#8217;re thinking of buying without a SIM because there are situations where it can be more beneficial to get something with a SIM included. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>For a long time, the mobile phone and the SIM card came hand-in-hand.
