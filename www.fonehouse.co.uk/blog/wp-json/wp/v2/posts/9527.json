With so many products we use daily, they are a brand we trust for their design and quality, and they never disappoint. Samsung are now one of the largest producers of electronic devices and continue to be at the forefront of people\u2019s minds when looking to upgrade their smartphones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Fonehouse, we know our customers love the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/brand\/samsung-mobile-phone-deals\">Samsung<\/a> brand, as do we. It is trusted, reliable and innovative \u2013 so, what is the history of Samsung phones and where did it all begin?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"where-was-samsung-founded\">Where was Samsung founded?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung was founded in 1938 in Daegu, South Korea, and was originally known as a grocery trader. The Samsung brand continually changed with the times, however, moving into the electronics sector in the late \u201960s. This is when they started manufacturing black and white televisions.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the opening of a new development centre in Poland in 2000, Samsung moved into the development of digital TV, eventually making the move into the world of smartphones in the late noughties.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung\u2019s first foray into the world of mobile telecommunications happened a lot earlier however, pioneering the development of mobile phones as early as the 1980s.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"when-was-the-first-samsung-phone-released\">When was the first Samsung phone released?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 1985 the first-ever Samsung phone, an in-car only cell phone, the SC-1000 was released. Sadly, the phone wasn\u2019t a massive success with consumers; the model was plagued with tech issues. The mixed reception to the SC-1000 spurred the Korean-based manufacturer on as they invested heavily in research and development. This culminated in the launch of the Samsung brand\u2019s first fully mobile telephone, the Samsung SH-100.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"460\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/1.jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung SH-100\" class=\"wp-image-9661\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/1-150x115.jpeg 150w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/1-300x230.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/1.jpeg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The Samsung SH-100 boasted several ground-breaking advancements and was also the first mobile phone to be manufactured in Korea. Following the blockbuster launch of its flagship phone, Samsung went from strength to strength, continually thriving in the highly competitive mobile phone market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"moving-with-the-times\">Moving with the times<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Between the late 1980s and the millennium, Samsung expanded its mobile phone range and customer offering. They released their first colour mobile phone, the SCH-X430 model, with an LCD colour screen, truly ground-breaking for the time.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Technology has developed at an unprecedented rate since the start of the millennium, and Samsung have continued to rise to the challenge and deliver well designed, high-quality products that withstand the test of time. From touch screens to Flip screens, Ultra and Plus models, Samsung have developed products with consumer needs and usability in mind.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"when-was-the-first-samsung-smartphone-made\">When was the first Samsung smartphone made?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung\u2019s first smartphone was the original Samsung Galaxy released way back on June 29<sup>th<\/sup> in 2009. The Samsung Galaxy GT-17500 boasted cutting edge technology that offered quad-band GSM and tri-band HSDPA.<a id=\"_msocom_1\"><\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"580\" height=\"227\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/SamsungGalaxyGTI7500LBellManualUserGuideSpecsOverview-1.jpeg\" alt=\"Samsung Galaxy GT-17500\" class=\"wp-image-9663\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/SamsungGalaxyGTI7500LBellManualUserGuideSpecsOverview-1-150x59.jpeg 150w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/SamsungGalaxyGTI7500LBellManualUserGuideSpecsOverview-1-300x117.jpeg 300w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/01\/SamsungGalaxyGTI7500LBellManualUserGuideSpecsOverview-1.jpeg 580w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Running off the then relatively new Android operating system (OS), this model pioneered the Samsung Galaxy line of devices, and helped shape and revolutionise how we use our mobile phones today. Samsung have since excelled in the Android (OS) market.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>For over a decade, Samsung have expanded their Galaxy S smartphone range as they have developed new and innovative models, they do not hold back when it comes to design and user capabilities.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Their most recent launch in the S range was the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g\">Samsung Galaxy S21<\/a>; 5G, triple-lens camera for high-resolution, professional images, built-in stereo speakers, and a long-lasting battery are to name only a few of the top features this high specification device has to offer.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"samsung-phones-2022-the-future-of-samsung-mobiles\">Samsung phones 2022: The Future of Samsung mobiles<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>2022 is an exciting year for Samsung.
