This device is perfect for anyone who\u2019s wanting to stick to a budget but enjoy the finer things in life. You don\u2019t have to choose one over the other. With our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-a71\\\">market leading Samsung Galaxy A71 deals<\/a>, you\u2019ll be even more convinced!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">A phone never looked so good<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Large screens are something that are almost essential in 2020. With the Galaxy A71, you can enjoy a 6.7 inch Infinity O display. Large screens allow us to enjoy things at a much larger, detailed view. Something that Samsung has done to offer a view larger than ever before is removing the bezels from the edge of the screen. This means that you can use every inch of this display to enjoy the things you love. They\u2019ve even reduced the selfie camera to a tiny punch hole! With such a high quality screen, it\u2019s easy to see why people are loving this phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Smooth, curved edges bring that overall high quality design over to the back of the phone too. With a glossy finish, this device is perfect for everyday whilst showing off a high end style. A patterned design on the phone adds that much more excitement and creates a smartphone unlike ever before. Every part of the patterned design will catch the light and offer a slightly different hue of your chosen colour. It\u2019s a great touch from Samsung! You won\u2019t be able to find a smartphone with a design like this, it\u2019s so unique.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">You\u2019re able to purchase the Samsung Galaxy A71 in Prism Crush Black, Blue and SIlver. With these colour options, you\u2019re given the chance to choose something that works with your style perfectly. They\u2019re all incredibly understated colours that offer nothing but class in it\u2019s design. Expressing yourself through your phone has never been so easy to achieve. Each of these editions is going to allow for a very tied together look, no matter what you\u2019re doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Check out the Samsung Galaxy A71 camera<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">On the back of the Samsung Galaxy A71, you can find a quad lens camera. For an affordable smartphone, this is huge! This camera consists of a 64MP main camera, 5MP depth lens, 12MP ultra wide lens and a 5MP macro sensor. The main lens is what you\u2019ll be using the most. It allows for a regular angle whilst capturing huge amounts of detail in one photo. The ultra wide lens is also something to pay attention to. It offers a 123 degree angle to shoot in. This is perfect for fitting more into one frame.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">If you\u2019re wanting to get a little more creative, the macro and depth lenses will be your best friends. Using the macro lens, you\u2019ll be able to shoot with more clarity than ever before. This lens is made to capture images up close. When you do this, you\u2019ll be able to photograph the finest of details in high resolution. Paired with Bokeh from the depth sensor, you\u2019ll have a photo to scream about. Using a depth lens, you\u2019ll be able to soften the background of a photo to isolate the subject. It creates an image that pops out against the rest and allows you to get creative.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">With such a powerful rear camera, we\u2019re sure you\u2019re expecting the same from the selfie camera. You aren\\&#8217;t going to be let down. Tucked into the tiny punch hole in the front of the Galaxy A71 is a 32MP selfie camera. We\u2019ll warn you now, it\u2019s an impressive one. Every single selfie you take is going to be high resolution and hole hundreds of different details. By softening the background on your selfies, you can even make sure that you\u2019re popping out more than ever before.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">There\u2019s a lot to love<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Behind the power of the Samsung Galaxy A71 is a 4500mAh battery, capable of some big things. With the Samsung Galaxy A71, you can stream, game and even talk all day. Just one full battery will allow you to go the entire day without worrying about a dead phone. When you do need to charge up the phone, it supports 25W super fast charging. This means that you\u2019ll be able to power up quicker than ever before so you can go about your day.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">You\u2019ll only get one option when it comes to internal memory, being 128GB. This is more than enough storage for the average person and allows you to hold more inside your phone. You won\u2019t have to worry about deleting data to make space for more. THere is also the option to use a microSD card to add up to 512GB of external memory. Whilst this device already has a huge memory option, this adds way more value to your phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Something Samsung is constantly doing is coming up with ways to make their smartphones different to everyone else\\&#8217;s. One way they do this is by introducing new features to their devices, such as Game Booster. This phone will learn your usage and optimise a number of different features so that you can have the smoothest graphics, extended battery life and even higher quality audio. It\u2019s perfect for gaming fanatics!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">WAIT&#8230;the price!<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Samsung have never priced their A range particularly high. This is the range that is meant to be affordable. If you want a mobile phone contract that doesn\u2019t break the bank, the A71 is perfect for you. This desirable new smartphone comes with an extremely low price tag. With a low monthly cost, you can put money into the things that matter more. Quality doesn\u2019t have to be expensive and the Galaxy A71 proves that completely.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Even if the Samsung Galaxy A71 doesn\u2019t sound like something you would enjoy, you can\u2019t deny it\u2019s an impressive handset. There are so many other choices if this isn\\&#8217;t the one for you. Whether you\u2019re on the lookout for something new or something cheap, we\u2019ve got what you need.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Smartphones are more desirable than ever before and once you get to know the Samsung Galaxy A71, we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll find your perfect match. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":5434,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"categories":[528],"tags":[347,355],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.3 -
