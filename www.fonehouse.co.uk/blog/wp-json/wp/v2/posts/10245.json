If you\u2019re interested in purchasing a SIM-free handset, this easy-to-read guide will help you to make an informed decision.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is SIM Free?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>To understand what SIM free is, it\u2019s helpful to first understand what a SIM card is. SIM stands for subscriber identity module, and it\u2019s a computer chip that connects you and identifies you to your network, as well as containing information like your phone number.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>A SIM free phone is exactly what it sounds like, it\u2019s a phone that comes without a SIM card.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This means you can purchase your own SIM card separately or even insert a SIM card from your old phone. It also means that you buy your phone upfront rather than through a pay monthly contract.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"731\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SIM-Free-Phones-1024x731.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10248\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SIM-Free-Phones-150x107.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SIM-Free-Phones-300x214.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SIM-Free-Phones-768x549.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SIM-Free-Phones-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SIM-Free-Phones-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SIM-Free-Phones-2048x1463.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How Do SIM Free Phones Work?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a SIM free handset you simply insert your SIM into your chosen phone. There are then three types of SIM only contract you can opt for. These are:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Pay As You Go SIMs<\/strong>: The data, minutes and texts on these SIM cards are topped up by the user whenever needed. This is a great cost-effective option if you\u2019re someone who doesn\u2019t use their phone much. However, if you, like many of us, use your phone a lot, the below options might be better for you.<\/li><li><strong>Contract SIMs<\/strong>: With this option you sign a contract which lasts for an agreed amount of time. During this time, you pay a certain monthly amount of money for a certain monthly amount of data, texts and minutes.<\/li><li><strong>Pay Monthly SIMs<\/strong>: Similar to the above option, except your contract rolls over every month. This gives you more freedom as you can cancel your contract 30 days in advance of the next rollover if needed.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Can You Put Any SIM in a SIM Free Phone?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Not quite. Firstly, your SIM card must be the appropriate size for your handset. Older phones tend to use mini (standard) size SIMs whilst newer phones generally use micro or nano SIMs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are also two types of SIM free phone. Network locked phones are for those who wish to change their handset but not their pay monthly deal as these phones will only work with SIMs from a particular network. On the other hand, unlocked phones will accept SIMs from any network as long as it is the correct size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"731\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SIM-Free-Guide-1024x731.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10249\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SIM-Free-Guide-150x107.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SIM-Free-Guide-300x214.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SIM-Free-Guide-768x549.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SIM-Free-Guide-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SIM-Free-Guide-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/SIM-Free-Guide-2048x1463.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why Buy a SIM Free Phone<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There are several reasons to choose a SIM free handset, such as:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Travel friendly<\/strong>: If you are someone who travels abroad a lot, a SIM free phone can come in handy. This is because you can switch out your SIM card for one available in the country you are visiting, enabling you to make calls and send texts in that country.<\/li><li><strong>Cost effective<\/strong>: Although SIM free phones have a higher up-front cost for the handset itself, many people save money in the long term. Especially because shopping for your phone and contract separately enables you to find the best deal.<\/li><li><strong>Freedom<\/strong>: With a SIM free phone, you can choose whichever network provider you like. And you won\u2019t have any locked features or network apps.<\/li><li><strong>Flexibility<\/strong>: You can change your phone whenever you like.<\/li><li><strong>High resale value<\/strong>: When changing your phone, you can sell your old SIM free phone for a great price thanks to its open compatibility.<\/li><li><strong>Less stress over credit checks: <\/strong>If you have a lower than average credit score, buying SIM free is a great option for you as the credit checks can be less rigorous- particularly with a Pay As You Go SIM only contract.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which Phones Are Available as SIM Free Handsets?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Fonehouse we have a number of excellent SIM free phones to choose from.
