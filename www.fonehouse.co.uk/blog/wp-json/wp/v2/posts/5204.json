What about the rest of the range?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\u2019re here to help you figure out the limitations of the Note 20 range when it comes to taking them in or near water.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What about the IP Rating?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When a new phone is released, manufacturers may choose to have it tested against small particles and liquids. Not all phones have this test as it can prove quite expensive. Anyone who does pay for this test normally already knows if it\u2019s resistant or not though. Having an official IP rating can make the phone far more desirable to consumers, having that extra bit of protection there. In terms of the Note 20, It has an IP68 rating, which means a few different things.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is an IP Rating?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In an IP rating the I represents the protection against small particles, i.e dust. When dust gets inside the phone, it can begin to eat away at different components in the phone. By letting these particles into the phone, you\u2019re going to experience your phone slowing down. To prevent that and extend a phone\u2019s life, brands may choose to make it resistant. With the Note 20, you can expect full resistance against dust particles. The 6 shows that the phone has the highest level of protection and is actually dust proof.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This then means that the P represents protection against liquid. In this case, the 8 shows just how water resistant the phone is. Everyone has seen or had a water damaged phone before. The screen goes all strange, it stops responding and over time, the phone completely dies. To avoid this unfixable damage, Samsung have designed the Note 20 to have a water resistance of 8. Currently, this is the highest level of water resistance. With this rating, you can tell that the Galaxy Note 20 is water resistant, but has some limits, but what exactly are those limits?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Limitations of the Samsung Galaxy Note 20<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, there are limitations to taking the Note 20 in water. When it comes to dust particles, there aren\u2019t any. The phone is completely dust proof so making sure that you take out any lumps of dirt from the ports will just keep that up. As the Samsung Galaxy isn\u2019t quite waterproof yet, you are going to have to be slightly more careful.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Follow these tips to prevent possible damage:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ol type=\"1\"><li>You should not take the Note 20 any deeper than 1.5 metres below water.<\/li><li>As you go deeper in the water, you\u2019re going to hit higher and higher pressures. The insides of the phone are built to withstand a certain amount of pressure. 1.5 metres is slightly above the average depth of a swimming pool. As long as you don\u2019t plan on deep sea diving with the Note 20, you should be fine. Any water splashing on it or dropping it down the toilet shouldn\u2019t harm the phone.When you do take it in the water, you shouldn\u2019t leave it in there any longer than 30 minutes.<\/li><li>If you leave the phone in water longer than this, it\u2019s likey that seals will loosen, and water will get into the phone. Once inside, there\u2019s a lot of harm that will happen. As long as you don\u2019t keep your phone on you whilst swimming around, you should be fine. Taking a few photos in the pool or under water photos for a few minutes should be absolutely fine.Don\u2019t expose the phone to high pressure water such as ocean waves or a waterfall<\/li><\/ol>\n\n\n\n<p>High pressure water can cause damage to your handset, as more water is likely to enter the phone and the seals are far more likely to become damaged.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Don\u2019t expose the handset to salt water or soapy water<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The salt and\/or chemicals can cause more damage to the integrity of the phone than fresh water can.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>When used in water, features such as the touchscreen may not work properly.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Is the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 waterproof?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, to answer the questions of, \u2018is the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 waterproof?\u2019, no. The&nbsp;Samsung Galaxy Note 20&nbsp;range isn\u2019t completely waterproof. Currently, no smartphone is completely waterproof. From the IP68 rating, we can tell that the phone is resistant in up to 1.5 metres of water for half an hour. If you push these limits, it\u2019s likely that the Note 20 will incur some kind of damage. Water resistance is not the same as waterproof so it\u2019s important to remember that. You can be sure that whether you opt for the lower end Note 20 or choose the highest specification Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, you\u2019ll get to enjoy the phone near water. If the phone does become water damaged, it wouldn\u2019t be covered by Samsung warranty. If you\u2019re going to push the limitations of the Note 20 range, we would advise that you make sure you\u2019ve got insurance. In some cases, insurances won\u2019t cover such damage so make sure you look into the terms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you can answer the question of, \u2018is the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 waterproof?\u2019 you\u2019ll be able to share the information. Keep your Note 20 safe and everyone else\u2019s too! In addition to the Note 20, many of Samsung&#8217;s latest releases are water resistant too \u2013 and get better and better with each release.
