Getting hold of a lower tier phone doesn\u2019t always mean bad. It just tends to mean that the design is a little less hard wearing or even the previous components were used to build it. With the Xperia L4, you get a lavish design, the best of Sony technology and some great bits under the bonnet.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Chic Sony Design<\/h2>\n<p>You will get to enjoy a 6.2 inch 21: Wide OLED display with each variant of the L4. A slim design is something you will find on a lot of different Sony smartphones. With each slim design, you\u2019ll be able to comfortably fit the phone into a single hand and operate it with no issues. You\u2019ll be able to enjoy everything you pull on screen in high amounts of details with the 6.2\u201d display as well.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re someone who loves to watch films or videos on your phone, the wide display is perfect for you. View footage as it\u2019s meant to be seen with a completely cinematic feeling. Not only is the wide display perfect for watching videos but, it\u2019s also great for a few of the new features. Multi-tasking will allow you to open up two different apps at once. You can reply to texts whilst watching films or even edit photos whilst on a call. The possibilities are endless with the wide Xperia L4 display.<\/p>\n<p>From the front of the phone, you get a huge sense of style but, this does roll over to the back of the phone too. With a plastic back, you\u2019ll get a clean, matte finish with each colour variant. Both Black and Blue options are available to purchase however, there is no difference other than colour. Express yourself through the Xperia L4 and find your perfect pairing. With such a slick design, you\u2019ll be able to match it with all your outfits too.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Meet the Camera Set Up<\/h2>\n<p>Sony has never really struggled to create an outstanding, impressive camera capable of producing some high resolution images. Of course, the camera is paired with a range of different features to create a more artistic photo. In the Sony Xperia L4 camera set up, you\u2019ll find a 13MP wide lens, 5MP ultrawide lens and a 2MP depth lens. Each lens plays a part in offering different angles or focal lengths. Each photo this camera produces can be expected to be extremely high quality and show a huge amount of detail and colour.<\/p>\n<p>Any regular photos will be captured with the wide lens. This lens is able to capture high amounts of detail, even in low lighting situations. Never miss the perfect photo opportunity again. If you want to get more of what\u2019s in front of you into a single frame, the ultrawide lens is your best friend. This lens will zoom out and give you more space to shoot. The final lens is the depth lens. With this one, you\u2019re going to be able to make your photos stand out massively. The background will be blurred whilst your subject is fully focused on.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>A Few Top Features<\/h2>\n<p>Whilst all the extra features included in the phone are super important, one of the most important components is the battery. The Xperia L4 was built with a long lasting 3580mAh battery to keep you going for long. You\u2019ll find yourself staying connected to the world for hours longer without having to worry about losing power. Whenever you do find yourself needing a little more power throughout the day, the L4 is actually compatible with fast charging. Pop your phone on to charge whilst you have a coffee and be ready to go about your day.<\/p>\n<p>There is also a super powerful processor keeping this phone going too. Paired with Wi-Fi and 4G, you\u2019ll get super great speeds for uploads and downloads. You\u2019ll even find these speeds reflecting in different apps, games and even videos.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Sony Xperia L4 Deals<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ll find a huge range of Xperia L4 deals available on Fonehouse with some of the best UK networks.
