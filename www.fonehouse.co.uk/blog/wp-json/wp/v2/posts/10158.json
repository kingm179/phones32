The first product sold by Apple was the Apple I personal computer, and from there the company continued to develop various computers \u2013 including the original Macintosh. In the late 1980s, Wozniak and Jobs stepped back from the company \u2013 taking on separate ventures.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a rocky few years in competition with Microsoft, Apple brought Steve Jobs back who guided Apple to profitability and introduced the likes of the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now we know Apple as one of the most successful tech companies in the world and as of January 2021, it was the most valuable company in the world.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The iPhone<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple CEO, Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone in January 2007. The handset, which wouldn\u2019t hit the shelves for another 6 months, was criticised as being too expensive for the market however looking back now we can see how the iPhone\u2019s success condemned its critics&#8217; remarks.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last 15 years, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/evolution-of-the-iphone\/\">the iPhone has evolved<\/a> to welcome various new internet speeds \u2013 first 3G, then 4G and now 5G. We have witnessed a range of camera updates \u2013 including the launch of the selfie camera and launches of key features we know today such as Siri, location services, Apple Music and accessories such as AirPods.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the Latest iPhone?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/iphone-13-hacks-1-1024x480.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10185\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/iphone-13-hacks-1-150x70.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/iphone-13-hacks-1-300x141.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/iphone-13-hacks-1-768x360.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/iphone-13-hacks-1-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/iphone-13-hacks-1.jpg 1280w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest iPhone is the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/iphone-13-5g\">iPhone 13 range<\/a> \u2013 featuring the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 13 range release saw praise for the updated camera and battery life. The iPhone 13 saw an increase in battery life of up to 99hrs, a 12MP camera and superfast 5G. Within the range is also the updated <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/iphone-13-pro-5g\">iPhone 13 Pro<\/a> which featured the biggest Pro camera upgrade ever \u2013 with a 12MP Telephoto, Wide and Ultra-Wide camera. The camera system also offers night mode, 4K Dolby Vision and HDR recording.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What is the Best iPhone?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone Range<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"480\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/iphone-SE-2022-1-1024x480-1.webp\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10191\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/iphone-SE-2022-1-1024x480-1-150x70.webp 150w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/iphone-SE-2022-1-1024x480-1-300x141.webp 300w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/iphone-SE-2022-1-1024x480-1-768x360.webp 768w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/iphone-SE-2022-1-1024x480-1.webp 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone range is the standard release of each iPhone \u2013 now we typically see four versions of new iPhones being released. The four are iPhone, iPhone Mini, iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max. Each handset features a range of exciting tech updates and new features.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone range contains plenty of exciting updates, and typically is priced at a lower point than its pro counterparts.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone Pro Range<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone Pro range takes the handset a little bit further in terms of camera quality and technical specifications. Apple defines its Pro models as the handset for those who want to get the most out of their device.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone Pro Max Range<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone Pro Max range typically has the exact same feature set as the iPhone Pro but in a bigger size. With the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, the Pro Max also has a larger battery capacity.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone SE Range<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone SE range is Apple\u2019s mid-range device range and offers a whole host of features you would find on the flagship range but at a lower cost. The SE range is perfect for those looking to own an iPhone and experience a range of features without the higher price point.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which iPhone Has the Best Camera?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignwide size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10218\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-150x84.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/04\/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Each iPhone release sees an improvement in camera quality \u2013 and the iPhone Pro ranges take that one step further. Therefore, currently, we can say that the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max have the best camera. Both models feature:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>Dual 12MP\/12MP front camera<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>Triple 12MP\/12MP\/12MP rear camera featuring a wide, telephoto and ultra-wide lens<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>4K Dolby Vision and HDR recording<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>When Does the New iPhone Come Out?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Typically, we can expect to see a new iPhone launched around September time each year \u2013 this has been the case for the past few years. We don\u2019t know much about the next iPhone launch but we are excited to see what improvements Apple have up their sleeve.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Which iPhone Should I Buy?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 13 Range<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest range from Apple features four models:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>iPhone 13<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>iPhone 13 Mini<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro Max<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>All four models see a huge upgrade from the previous device and have some of the best camera and battery technology available.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/iphone-13-5g\">iPhone 13<\/a> features the most advanced dual-camera system ever seen on an iPhone, the fastest chip; A15 Bionic chipset and one of the biggest advances in battery life we\u2019ve seen. With superfast 5G and a super durable and timeless design, this handset has impressed us all. You have various colour choices when it comes to the iPhone 13, including Midnight, Red, Blue, Pink and Starlight (white). The iPhone 13 also comes in a smaller size, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/iphone-13-mini-5g\">iPhone 13 Mini<\/a> \u2013 perfect for smaller hands and compact enough to fit in pockets and handbags \u2013 the Mini features all the same technology just in a handy size.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you\u2019re looking to elevate your handset that bit further, we recommend you try the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/iphone-13-pro-5g\">iPhone 13 Pro<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/iphone-13-pro-max-5g\">Pro Max<\/a>. If you enjoy taking photos on your device and need that little bit of extra battery life, we think the swish 13 Pro range is for you. You can impress your friends with the latest technology and take all the best images of your social life, landscapes, wildlife and more with the triple 12MP rear camera.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 12 Range<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/iphone-12-5g\">iPhone 12<\/a> was 2020\u2019s flagship range and saw the introduction of a clean new design and a breadth of colourways. It was also the first time we saw the introduction of the iPhone Mini. The iPhone 12 range\u2019s main updates included increased power and the introduction of 5G. In the iPhone 12 range we see:<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><strong>iPhone 12<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>iPhone 12 Mini<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>iPhone 12 Pro<\/strong><\/li><li><strong>iPhone 12 Pro Max<\/strong><\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to the 13, the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini see a dual rear camera whereas the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/iphone-12-pro-5g\">Pro and Pro Max<\/a> see a triple-lens rear camera. The differences between the standard and pro ranges remain similar \u2013 improved camera and battery life.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The iPhone 12 range features the A14 Bionic chip, therefore providing great speeds and power.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone 11<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>With the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/apple-iphone-11\">iPhone 11,<\/a> we saw the very first Pro and Pro Max additions, as well as a change in screen size and camera improvements. To this day the iPhone 11 range remains a great choice for a powerful phone with great image quality.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can get a whole host of colour options with the iPhone 11, including Black, White, Green, Yellow, Red and Purple.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone XR and XS<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Subsequent releases from the iPhone X are the XR and XS. The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/apple-iphone-xr\">iPhone XR<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/apple-iphone-xs\">iPhone XS<\/a> were released at the same time \u2013 with the XR being a lower-cost version of the XS. There isn\u2019t a massive difference between the two phones, but the XS features better screen quality, sleeker design and the inclusion of 3D touch.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3>iPhone SE (2020)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we have the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/apple-iphone-se-2020\">iPhone SE<\/a> (2020).
