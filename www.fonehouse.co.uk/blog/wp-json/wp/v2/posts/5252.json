When you call through to the other person, it will come up as an unknown number, even if they have you saved as a contact in their phone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Deter Thieves<\/h2>\n<p>When someone steals a phone, one of the first things they do is turn Airplane Mode on to make sure you can\u2019t track them through Find My iPhone. By locking the control centre from the lock screen, thieves won\u2019t be able to do this, resulting in you getting your phone back\u2026hopefully.
