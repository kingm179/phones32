Most of you know what happened next, but for those of you that don\u2019t, Samsung released the two best looking phones they ever made; Galaxy S6 and S6 Edge. \u00a0Shortly afterwards we received the third iteration in the form of S6 Edge+ sporting a slightly larger screen and some additional features.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Like its siblings, S6 Edge+ comes with a gorgeous metal design representing a huge departure from their previous efforts. Old Samsungs weren\u2019t ugly by any means, but they weren\u2019t inspiring either. Designed with simplicity and quality in mind, they failed to provoke an emotional reaction leading to spontaneous purchases. The new models however take an entirely different approach by sporting an unbelievably good-looking chassis mated to a curved screen on both edges.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> Words simply fail to describe how monumental the change is, especially on a large device such as S6 Edge+. Hinted by the name, S6 Edge+ is truly a plus sized device sporting dimensions of 154.4 x 75.8 x 6.9 mm and weighing in at 153 grams. Nonetheless, it is a very comfortable smartphone designed primarily for two-handed use.<\/span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In terms of display, Samsung decided to use only the finest components thereby opting for a 5.7 inch AMOLED display producing a resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels resulting in a density of 518ppi. Once you spend some time with it, there simply isn\u2019t going back. Colors are so wonderfully rich, they make an everlasting impression. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Whether you\u2019re watching multimedia or playing games, S6 Edge+ over-delivers in every single area. It might take a moment or two getting used to curved edges, but once you do, get ready for an unforgettable experience.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Powering Galaxy S6 Edge Plus is Samsung\u2019s own Exynos 7420 merging together a quad-core 1.5 GHz Cortex-A53 and a quad-core 2.1 GHz Cortex-A57. We\u2019ve seen a lot of ARM big.LITTLE chipsets where the smaller CPU powers simple tasks like web browsing while the more powerful core deals with intensive tasks such as gaming. The clear advantage is better power efficiency combined with lower heat emissions. On the software side, Edge+ uses Android 5.1.1. overlaid with Samsung\u2019s revamped TouchWiz. Unlike before, they dealt away with unnecessary bloatware leaving only a few decent apps such as S Health, Smart Manager and SideSync. SideSync is one of our favorites since it allows mirroring a phone\u2019s screen on any computer including Macs. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">This eliminates the need to constantly check on your phone significantly improving productivity. One thing we don\u2019t like about the new Samsungs is the fact that microSD slots have been removed, leaving you to choose between 32 or 64 gigabyte on-board memory.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> Worth mentioning is the fact that it comes with a colossal 4GB of DDR4 RAM future-proofing you for a long long time. Imaging-wise, S6 Edge+ sports the same spectacular camera setup as its siblings with an ultra-fast 16-megapixel main camera and a 5-megapixel front camera. There are plenty of settings to explore or you can just use the auto mode for excellent photos in any environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Galaxy S6 Edge+ is a brilliant phone in many ways aimed primarily at users looking for more screen space and unrivaled performance. Seeing that Galaxy Note 5 won\u2019t be coming to European markets, S6 Edge+ is a worthy replacement for those who haven\u2019t developed a fondness for the S Pen. Those who did will have to readjust slightly, but it\u2019s definitely going to be worth it!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Designers were at a crossroad as drastic measures had to be taken in order to change the visual identity.
