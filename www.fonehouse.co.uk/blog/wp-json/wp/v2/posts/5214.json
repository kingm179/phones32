After waiting for months, the excitement around this handset has been confirmed. All the amazing rumours have been proven and we\u2019ve even seen a few new features that you\u2019re going to love too.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s on the inside?<\/h2>\n<p>The insides of any phone is where you\u2019re going to want to know what\u2019s going on. With different key components, you can get one of the most important phones ever. Inside the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra, you can find some legendary pieces of kit. For example, the brains of the phone is an Exynos 990 chipset. With this chip, you\u2019re going to be able to experience faster speeds than ever before. Paired with a 5G ready plan, you\u2019ll get to enjoy buffer free streaming and uninterrupted uploads and downloads.<\/p>\n<p>With help from the Exynos chip, you\u2019ll also get an amazing battery life. Inside the Note 20 Ultra is a 4500mAh battery that\u2019s capable of holding hours\u2019 worth of use. Even if you stream, download, upload or play games, you should find that the battery doesn\u2019t drop too much. Whenever you do find the battery running low, you can choose from the multitude of charging capabilities to power it back up. This includes fast charging, fast wireless charging and even reverse wireless charging. Never find yourself stuck with a dead phone when you\u2019ve got the Note 20 Ultra.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of memory amounts, the Note 20 Ultra only comes in 256GB. This isn\u2019t a bad thing at all. This memory storage is a huge amount which usually sits at the highest amount on offer. With this being the standard storage option, you\u2019ll find that you\u2019re able to store endless amounts of data on the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra. If you even do run low, there\u2019s no room for external memory to be added so you would need to take a look at other cloud storage options.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Camera System<\/h2>\n<p>In the past few months, we\u2019ve seen nothing but quality from the Samsung camera systems. From the S20 range to the A71, Samsung have seriously upped their game in the photography area. If a camera set up is something you\u2019re in great need of, look no further than the Note 20 Ultra. Featured on the front of the phone, there\u2019s a tiny 10MP punch hole camera and this can do some great things. You\u2019re going to be experiencing some of the clearest, most detailed selfies you\u2019ve ever seen. Enjoy real life colours and textures to truly show off the beauty in your photos.<\/p>\n<p>Featured on the back of the phone, you can find the triple camera setup. Now, if you thought the selfie camera was impressive, wait until you see what\u2019s involved with this camera. Starting with the 12MP telephoto lens, you\u2019re going to get some fun focal lengths from this phone. Zoom right in and join the party without ever moving from your spot. Telephoto lenses are common amongst cameras nowadays but you\u2019ve never seen one this high quality before. If you want to zoom in the highest quality, the Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra is for you.<\/p>\n<p>Backing up this is also a 12MP ultra wide camera. Again, these are pretty common amongst cameras but this one is incredibly high quality. With this lens, you\u2019ll be able to take a step back and capture more in a single photo. Really enjoy never having to struggle to squeeze something in again. The final lens, and most impressive one, is the 108MP main camera. Of course, we had to leave the best until last. Using this powerful lens, you\u2019ll be able to capture the world in detail like never before. Enjoy the true to life colours and even low light scenario shooting from this camera.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra Deals<\/h2>\n<p>We\u2019ve gathered the very <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-note-20-ultra\\\">best Samsung Galaxy Note 20 Ultra deals<\/a> in one place so that you don\u2019t have to waste time searching other sites. To make sure our deals are top off the market, we pair them with different cashback amounts. These will take down the total cost of your contract and allow you to save money where you least expected to save it. With both redemption and automatic cashback, you can choose how much you save and how you save it. We\u2019ve made sure that there\u2019s something for everyone.<\/p>\n<p>For anyone looking for something low maintenance, the automatic cashback offers are perfect for you. These allow you to forget about the payments and have a nice reminder when you see it on your bank statement. There is absolutely nothing you need to do in order to get this money paid. We will automatically process the full cashback amount after 90 days in order to pay it to you shortly after. Simply pay your monthly bills on time and we\u2019ll do the rest.<\/p>\n<p>Redemption cashback is a little more technical but allows you to get huge amounts of money back from your phone bill.
