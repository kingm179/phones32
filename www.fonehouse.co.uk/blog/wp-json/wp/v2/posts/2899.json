Do you enjoy nothing more than feeling the wind through your hair as you pound the pavements on a gruelling long distance run? Is there no better feeling than the rush of endorphins after an intense workout? If this all sounds familiar then you need to make sure that you have the perfect smartphone to compliment your active lifestyle. Fortunately we have a handset recommendation that is perfect for all of you sporty types.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/iPhone-SE-32GB\\\">The iPhone SE may look small<\/a>, but you know what they say\u2026\u201dgreat things come in small packages\u201d and none more so than with this little handset.<\/p>\n<p>If you fitness is your priority, then the last thing you need is a heavy, oversized smartphone that won\u2019t fit in any pockets and weighs you down. While a larger screen can be great, it\u2019s not always the most practical option, particularly if you find yourself constantly on the move. The iPhone SE holds all of the technology of the advanced iPhone 6S, but contains all of that exceptionally innovative technology in 4-inch casing. Weighing just 113 grams, you can be sure that if you\u2019re carrying your phone in a pocket or armband when on the go; you won\u2019t even notice it\u2019s there.<\/p>\n<p>Don\u2019t be deceived by the smaller size though, if you\u2019re an enthusiastic trail runner, climber or outdoors enthusiast who likes to take a break to snap a few pictures of your beautiful natural surroundings, you\u2019ll be impressed with the 12MP camera that the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/iPhone-SE-32GB\\\">iPhone SE packs<\/a>; perfect for posting those all important Instagram shots after an intense workout, or to show off your progress on your fitness journey. The 4K video capacity is perfect for filming exercise routines at high quality to share with your friends and followers.<\/p>\n<p>You don\u2019t need to worry about always pulling your phone out or pausing your workout to change song, make a call or find out what time you\u2019re on. With Apple\u2019s intelligent AI Siri, you have your very own personal assistant to keep you organised and on track when you\u2019re working out.<\/p>\n<p>With a minimum of 32GB the iPhone SE holds plenty of room for all of your favourite sporting apps. If running is your thing, then we recommend the Nike+ Run Club app; it\u2019s already revered by athletes around the world and is excellent for tracking all of your outdoor runs. Or, if you\u2019re happier on your bicycle, give Strava a go; it\u2019s a great online platform for tracking and sharing all of your favourite routes, and allows you to support your friends and followers. We also love MyPlate for nutrition tracking and for opening users eyes with easy to follow meal plans.<\/p>\n<p>Complete your iPhone SE with some fantastic fitness accessories. Get rid of inconvenient wires by investing in a pair of good quality, sports specific wireless headphones which allow users to listen to their all important gym playlists via Bluetooth and give complete freedom of movement when working out. Or, for those warmer summer days, don\u2019t worry about layering up or carrying a bag; get your hands on a sports armband and you\u2019ll barely notice your handset when working out.<\/p>\n<p>There are some fantastic\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/iPhone-SE-32GB\\\">iPhone SE pay monthly deals<\/a>\u00a0that have brilliant added extras for fitness enthusiasts. With EE you can take advantage of six months of free Apple music, allowing you to easily stream all of your favourite workout tunes. Alternatively for those all important rest days, you can choose a BT Sport subscription to go along with your contract, meaning you\u2019ll never miss out on your favourite game.<\/p>\n<p>So next time you head off on a gruelling run, intense bike ride or make your way to the gym for leg day, don\u2019t forget your all important iPhone SE. The smartphone packs a lot of power for its size, and you can be sure it won\u2019t weigh you down, or let you down, when you\u2019re on the go. Now, tie up your laces, start your favourite playlist, and get out there!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Do you prefer to spend your days working away the hours in the gym?
