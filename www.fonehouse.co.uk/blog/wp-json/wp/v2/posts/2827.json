Below are a few quick tips on how to setup your S9\u2019s home screen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Setup your S9 to work in landscape<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a new feature for Samsung and helps when using your smartphone for watching movies or playing games. It comes set as off as default, but you can turn this on by going to settings, then to home screen, then to portrait mode. Here you can turn off portrait move to make your phone work in both portrait and landscape.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Resizing widgets on your homepage<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Most smartphone widgets are resizable, hold down on the widget for a long time and when you take your finger off you can drag the box that appears to resize whichever widgets you want.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Customise your S9 navigation bar<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is not new to the S9 and first appeared on the S8. This helps you change the order of buttons and the background colour. To do this just go to settings, then to navigation bar and you can change colours and buttons here quickly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Quickly creating a folder on your Galaxy S9<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>For those who like a tidy screen you can quickly organise your apps into folders by simply dropping one app onto another. If you need to remove any app from a folder just hold down on the app and a pop-up menu will appear giving you the option to remove the app.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Changing folder name or colour<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>When you open a folder, you have the option to give the folder a name and apply any colour your wish. To change the colour of a folder just press the palette in the right-hand corner and choose a new colour. You can even customise your own colours for those who want their own stamp on their S9 or S9 plus.<br \/>\n<strong>How to delete a folder on your S9<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Nothing new here. Just hold down any app and press delete.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Personalise your Galaxy S9\u2019s home screen<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Making your smartphone your own is fun, you spend a lot of time looking at your home screen, so you might as well make it personal. Hold down on the wallpaper and you can edit your themes and wallpaper. This also lets you delete or add different screens, so you can personalise any screen on the S9 quickly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Accessing Google Now<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Google now came with Android Lollipop. Google pulls together all the information from your history and Google accounts. You can access this by pressing the Google search bar widget.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Getting more apps on your home screen<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is a great feature. You can customise the grid on the home screen, or any other screen to hold more widgets, apps and shortcuts. Hold down the wallpaper and go to home screen settings. You can select how many boxes you want from top to bottom and left to right.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Changing the S9\u2019s home screen launcher<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This is another feature for anyone who wants to personalise the launch page. You can use apps like Nova which is available from the App store. Setting this up is simple, go to settings, then to apps, then press the menu button on the right. Here you can select default apps and then home screen. There is a good choice of launchers which are already there to choose from. You can get multiple launcher pages on the App store, but we would recommend reading the reviews. Some apps can start to drain your battery and make the phone hot.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to lock the navigation bar<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As the Galaxy S9 is a large display Samsung have tried to use the full screen, sometimes this can be annoying. You can lock the navigation bar in place by pressing the dot on the left of the navigation bar. If you want to unlock this later just double tap the dot again and its unlocked.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Personalising the S9\u2019s status bar<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This can be useful when you don\u2019t want to see notifications all day long. It allows you to move things like the battery bars etc. To do this go to settings, then to display and then to status bar.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Quickly accessing Bixby<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Samsung have put a lot of time into Bixby and Samsung S9 and S9 pls users have been raving about it. Its like Google Assistant just Samsung\u2019s own version. You can access Bixby by pressing the Bixby buttons on the side of the device. Alternatively, you can swipe right on the home screen.<\/p>\n<p><strong>How to turn Bixby Off on the S9<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>If you are happy with Google assistant and want to turn off Bixby press down on the wallpaper, go to home screen controls and Bixby home panel will open. You have the option here to turn Bixby off.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Quickly access Google Assistant\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Hold down virtual on your home screen button and you can then talk to Google on the move.
