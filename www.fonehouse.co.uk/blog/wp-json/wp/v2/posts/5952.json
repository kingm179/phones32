In true Apple style, the announcement of the September 14<sup>th<\/sup> event did not allude to any specific devices \u2013 but it is widely anticipated to include the new iPhone as well as potentially a new Apple watch and even a new iPad.<\/p>\n<p>The event invite features an augmented reality component which lets users look through an Apple shaped portal and see a presumed Californian landscape.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Handset Rumours <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>It is has come to be expected that with any iPhone release, there will be a range of handset options. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/www.trustedreviews.com\/news\/iphone-13-release-date-specs-features-leaks-4106939\\&quot;\" data-wplink-edit=\"true\">Trusted Reviews<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macrumors.com\/2021\/09\/07\/magsafe-charger-filing-new-iphones\/\">Mac Rumours<\/a>, this year will be no different. It is rumoured that once again there will be four handset variations. The names of the handsets are alleged to be: iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Price and Pre-Order Rumours <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Like everything Apple, the price of the rumoured new iPhone is completely under wraps. But sites, such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/uk\/deals\/iphone-13-deals-how-much-is-apples-latest-device-likely-to-cost\">TechRadar<\/a> who predict these things year on year have taken a stab at what the new phone could be priced at.<\/p>\n<p>It is suggested that what could be called the iPhone 13 will be fairly similar in spec to the iPhone 12 therefore they expect it will have a similar price point. If previous launch events are anything to go by, it is anticipated that pre-orders for the device will begin just a few days after the event \u2013 so maybe the Thursday or Friday.<\/p>\n<p>Going by previous launches, and the fact Apple has remained fairly consistent lately with price points \u2013 TechRadar suggests that the new iPhone could be priced around \u00a3799 \u2013 the same as the iPhone 12. If past releases are anything to go by, it is also rumoured there could be an iPhone 13 Mini, Pro and Pro Max. They are rumoured to cost, \u00a3699, \u00a3999 and \u00a31099 respectively.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Design Rumours <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Little change is expected in design from the iPhone 12. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/uk\/news\/new-iphone-13-2021#section-iphone-13-design\">TechRadar has reported<\/a> that there is a potential change in design to the rear camera. It is expected that the lenses will sit in a diagonal pattern. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macworld.com\/article\/234814\/2021-iphone-13-rumors-specs-price-release.html\">MacWorld does report<\/a> that the change in camera design could also see a slightly larger camera \u2018bump\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>The other design change that has been highly suggested is a smaller notch, as a result of potentially smaller Face ID sensor. With the Pro and Pro Max, the situation is similar \u2013 not many design changes are expected. The only rumours really are surrounding colour options, and potentially less fingerprint prone stainless steel.<\/p>\n<p>In terms of colour \u2013 we may see some new shades released with the iPhone 13 \u2013 <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/uk\/news\/new-iphone-13-2021\">TechRadar reports<\/a> we might see pink and orange and others similar to the 12 like purple. Similar reports have been made by <a href=\"https:\/\/www.macworld.com\/article\/234814\/2021-iphone-13-rumors-specs-price-release.html\">MacWorld<\/a> \u2013 with iPhone 12 colours all expected to remain.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Display Rumours <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>Again, screen sizes and resolution are not expected to differ much from the iPhone 12. However, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/uk\/news\/new-iphone-13-2021\">TechRadar reports<\/a> that the Pro and Pro Max versions could see 120Hz refresh rates. Additionally, they expect to see an always-on display on each of the potential new handsets.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.macworld.com\/article\/234814\/2021-iphone-13-rumors-specs-price-release.html\">MacWorld reports<\/a> that this \u2018always-on\u2019 display could mean we constantly get to see the time, and battery life \u2013 perhaps even notifications.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Camera Rumours <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/uk\/news\/new-iphone-13-2021\">TechRadar suggests<\/a> Apple is expected to tweak the camera on the new handset series. There are a range of rumours \u2013 from an upgraded ultra-wide shooter on the pro handsets as well as an upgraded telephoto camera. Video recording improvements are also expected, including a new portrait mode.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Spec Rumours<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/uk\/news\/new-iphone-13-2021\">According to TechRadar<\/a>, the handsets will be powered by the A15 chipset and there are even big rumours flying around that there could be a 1TB iPhone for the first time in 2021. The largest size of &nbsp;iPhone ever made.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Battery Rumours <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>There have been numerous rumours about the battery expected on the new iPhone. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/uk\/news\/new-iphone-13-2021\">TechRadar<\/a> suspects that this will be much larger than previous versions \u2013 offering better battery life than any previous iPhones. Something Apple fans will be very happy to hear.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.macworld.com\/article\/356647\/bigger-batteries-could-be-the-star-of-apples-september-event.html\">MacWorld reported<\/a> that the mini handset could see an additional 1 hour of battery life, whilst the rumoured iPhone 13 and Pro could see an increase in battery capacity of 10%. The Pro Max is anticipated to see a huge 18-20% capacity increase.<\/p>\n<h2><strong>Satellite Communication Rumours <\/strong><\/h2>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.tomsguide.com\/uk\/news\/iphone-13-release-date-price-specs-leaks\">Tom\u2019s Guide have reported<\/a> that the new iPhone is tipped to get satellite communication \u2013 which would be the first time for an iPhone. This feature would enable users to make calls or send messages without any 4G or 5G connection. This feature would be revolutionary for emergency calls \u2013 for example if you get stranded with no service.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><!--vcv no format--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple has confirmed they are hosting an event on September 14th at 6pm BST (10am PT\/1pm ET).
