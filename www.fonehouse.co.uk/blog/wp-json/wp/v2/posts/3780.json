It has many features which help to endear it to a modern audience, including the ability to turn on the battery percentage and track how long you\u2019ll be able to go before you have to recharge.<\/p>\n<p>But how do you find this function and turn it on? Well, it\u2019s not as advertised as you would like, so it involves a little bit of trial and error and searching. Alternatively, we can show you in this guide.<\/p>\n<h2><b>Showing Battery Percentage<\/b><\/h2>\n<p>Okay, so here\u2019s the thing. The battery percentage is always there. You can\u2019t see it most of the time. Strange, right? If this is confusing to you, then you\u2019re not the only one &#8211; we were a touch perplexed when we first got access to the XR to play with ourselves. You see, it used to be that you had to go into the settings application and switch it on from inside accessibility. That was the given for all models which came before the iPhone 8. But the technology for the phone has advanced so much since then that you\u2019ll need to do something completely different here.<\/p>\n<p>So, do you remember the control centre? It\u2019s like a central hub for you to access a lot of different features concerning your mobile device &#8211; it gives you information about the audio you\u2019re listening to, lets you turn on a torch, access your camera, and a full selection of other things. Remember this because it\u2019s quite essential.<\/p>\n<p>See, the current generation of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/brand\/apple-mobile-phone-deals\">iPhones<\/a> have evolved past the point of having to toggle their battery percentages. The bezel at the top is designed that there isn\u2019t any room for the battery percentage to be there all the time. Instead, you access it by bringing up your control centre app, which is accessible by swiping down from the top-right selection.\u00a0 That will give you access to the control centre, and then if you look at the top right of the screen, you\u2019ll see your battery percentage. Helpful, right?<\/p>\n<p>So as you can probably tell, it\u2019s not all that difficult for people to access their battery percentage whenever they want to. Apple may not have been able to keep it all in one place, but the option to view it is there, and it\u2019s easy to work with. You can tell that even though they\u2019ve tried to make something easy to work with, there\u2019s been no massive failure in terms of design. It doesn\u2019t matter, especially that you can\u2019t see the battery all the time, because most people don\u2019t need to. They need to check on it from time to time to assure themselves that they can keep going without a new battery.<\/p>\n<p>Apple has made an incredible device, and that\u2019s easy to see. It\u2019s smart, functional, and it gives you everything you could need for getting the most from your device from the beginning. So all that you need to do is to make sure you\u2019ve checked the battery now and then, and you\u2019ll be good to go.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The iPhone XR is one of the most powerful and capable devices ever to be produced and is the latest offering by the giant known as Apple.
