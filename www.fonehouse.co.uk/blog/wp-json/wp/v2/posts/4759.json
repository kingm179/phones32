Everyone is doing as much as they can at the moment and every bit counts. Each network has taken a look at how they can help the UK by making the smallest changes resulting in easier days.<\/p>\n<h2>What are networks doing?<\/h2>\n<p>EE, Three and Vodafone are all following very similar lines with how they\u2019re helping their customers during these hard times. Anyone on these networks will be able to get on to the NHS UK website without using any of your data. This includes customers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, you will be able to access the NHS website relevant to you.<\/p>\n<p>For anyone who has run out of data already, you will still be able to access the NHS websites. Whether you\u2019re on a SIM only plan or a pay monthly phone contract, you will be able to make use of this. This deal stands for as long as we are dealing with this terrible crisis in the UK.<\/p>\n<h2>How does this help me?<\/h2>\n<p>This helps all customers as you will be able to keep informed with all updates no matter your situation. Not everyone has access to a radio or data to listen to news updates but this way, you\u2019ll be able to keep in contact with the front line.<\/p>\n<p>From the NHS websites you can find conditions, symptoms and treatments for all illnesses, not just COVID-19. For those worried about the spreading virus, you will be able to find symptoms and the latest advice on how to deal with it. You will also be able to find details regarding travelling advice.<\/p>\n<h2>What are Fonehouse doing?<\/h2>\n<p>Our team are working as hard as they can to make sure orders are processed and dispatched within the correct time frames.
