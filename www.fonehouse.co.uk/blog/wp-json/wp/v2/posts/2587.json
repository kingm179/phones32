It was also the last of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/iPhone\\\">iPhones<\/a> to come with a headphone jack which has now been removed, it would appear, on a permanent basis from all new handsets. \u00a0Around the time of its release the trend was to make smaller and smaller handsets which does not suit all users.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\u00a0<\/span>The iPhone 6 is bigger than its predecessors and made a welcome to change for many customers. It does feature a lot of glass and although this is toughened<\/p>\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Ion-strengthened glass with oleo-phobic coating we would still recommend a case be used as this is not the sort of phone you would want to drop.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\u00a0<\/span>This handset comes with an Apple A8 chip which offers a fast responsive user experience and an ease of use that iPhone fans know and love.<\/p>\n<h3>Getting a Handset Free<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/iPhone-6\\\">The contract price for an iPhone 6 is lower<\/a> than some of the newer handsets which works in favour of the customer. As we have already seen this is a great high spec mobile that featured the newest Apple technology at the time, and to be fair ages incredibly well.<\/p>\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We have sourced some of the best iPhone 6, deals many of which mean that the handset is essentially free when you start the contract. \u00a0In reality of course the cost is absorbed into the contract but the prices are so good that it is still the best way to get the phone you want at a price you can afford.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\u00a0<\/span>If you check out the deals you will see that there are lots offering the free handset, some that offer cash back as well which further lowers the monthly price. \u00a0All you have to do is decide on the remaining terms of the contract.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\u00a0<\/span>You can opt to have a deal that has unlimited talk time and texts which means you are never in danger of going over your allowance. Finally you need to consider your data allowance when you are using the phone for apps or the internet and are not connected to a wireless network. \u00a0You could get 4GB of data each month with no upfront cost for just \u00a322, so check out the deals now!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple are one of those companies you either love or hate. \u00a0It has to be said that whatever they do seems to hit the ground running and receive cult level support and following. \u00a0In the mobile phone world this means that the handsets they built a few years ago are still very valuable tools and make a popular choice for many people. \u00a0<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3812,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"categories":[526],"tags":[71],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.3 -
