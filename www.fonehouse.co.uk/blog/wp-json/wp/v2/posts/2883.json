For years they have consistently released flagship handsets that have never failed to impress users time and time again. But does their latest release, the Huawei P20, live up to the previous expectations that Huawei have set? Following the release, we at Fonehouse couldn\u2019t wait to find out.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Look<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Upon taking the Huawei P20 out of the box there\u2019s no denying the beauty in the design of this phone.<\/p>\n<p>According to Huawei themselves, the P20\u2019s look was inspired by \u2018the luminous waves of light energy that fill our cosmos\u2019, and while that may sound a little over dramatic, we can kind of see where they\u2019re coming from. The P20 combines elegant curves and glass body that truly shines when you hold it in the palm of your hand. Available in five different colours, and with an exclusive gradient finish available with the Twilight and Pink Gold bodies, there\u2019s bound to be a P20 that catches your attention and fits with your style persona.<\/p>\n<p>The phone also feels extremely durable, with an all Gorilla Glass body, however Huawei have been completely honest in admitting that the Twilight and Midnight Blue phones can show signs of wear over time due to their high gloss finish. While it is a disappointing admittance, we can;t help but feeling that it is highly commendable for such a big brand to state this so openly, and the issue can be combated by using a protective case, which many will use regardless.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Tech<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The P20 comes with a 5.8 inch FullView display that delivers a stunning viewing experience, whether you\u2019re reading content, working on the go or watching your favourite Netflix show. An edge to edge screen, with edgeless fingerprint sensor, results in a smartphone that is almost entirely screen and is perhaps only rivalled by the iPhone X.<\/p>\n<p>The Huawei P20 is undoubtedly a powerful handset which requires an equally powerful processor to keep it running. The Kirin 970 chipset enables the P20 to run at an impressive speed, making for a responsive smartphone experience that won\u2019t frustrate you by lagging during the use of numerous apps.<\/p>\n<p>Another feature that really helps the P20 live upto the Huawei standards that we\u2019ve come to expect is the 3400mAh battery. With a battery this size you don\u2019t need to worry about running out of power when you\u2019re at work or out and about. At Fonehouse we\u2019ve found the battery to be one of the most impressive features of the phone; it really does pack a punch. Plus, an extra convenience is that when you eventually run out of power, you can utilise Huawei\u2019s SuperCharge cable and charger for super fast charging.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Camera<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The P20 packs an impressive 20MP Dual Leica camera setup unlike anything users have seen before. The partnership with Leica will have photography enthusiasts going weak at the knees, and any amateur an now expect to take their skills to the next level simply with the help of their smartphone camera.<\/p>\n<p>When you add to that wide aperture lenses and a large image sensor with a pixel size of 1.55 micrometers, you can be sure that you\u2019ll always take clear pictures in any lighting conditions. Plus, with image stabilisation, a fantastic 24MP front camera and 3D portrait lighting, it\u2019s not only your photographs that will look brilliant, but each and every selfie will always have you looking your best.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>The Price<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The Huawei P20 entered the smartphone market as a mid range phone, and while the technology and design of the phone really do, in our opinion, cast it leagues ahead of other mid range handsets, the price remains modest.<\/p>\n<p>You can get your hands on the\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Huawei-P20?\\\">Huawei P20\u00a0<\/a>from as little as an astonishing \u00a329 per month with no upfront cost. There are some truly amazing value pay monthly deals available on this smart little handset, but if you are on the hunt for a great SIM free phone, then you can purchase the Huawei P20 for \u00a3599.99 outright, not a bad price by any standards, especially when you consider that fact that the P20 rivals some of the most highly rated high end smartphones currently launching; this is one handset you don\u2019t want to overlook.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Huawei have long been regarded as one of the most reputable mobile communications manufacturers in the world, and with good reason.
