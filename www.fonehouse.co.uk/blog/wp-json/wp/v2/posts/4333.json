However, if you\u2019re new to the Apple series, navigating your way through all the techy commands and functions can be a little confusing.<\/p>\n<h2>How to Save Your Screenshot<\/h2>\n<p>Congratulations \u2013 now you know how to take a screenshot on an iPhone 11, you\u2019re going to want to save it for later use.
