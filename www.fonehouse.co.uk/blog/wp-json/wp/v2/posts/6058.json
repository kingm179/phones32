Whilst we have seen some September sun, the colder days are approaching and what better way to make sure you\u2019re ready than to have the best ranked weather apps at your fingertips. At Fonehouse we know how important it is to be prepared for whatever the weather might throw at you, so we\u2019ve gathered lots of data to collate a list of the top 10 weather apps.<\/p>\n<p>We all know that App store ratings are not always the best judge of an app \u2013 after all, it depends on a number of other factors such as the number of reviews, app features and whether or not you get inundated with ads.<\/p>\n<p>Therefore, to come up with our list we\u2019ve collected <a href=\"https:\/\/play.google.com\/store?gl=GB\">Google Play<\/a> ratings and reviews, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.apple.com\/uk\/app-store\/\">Apple store<\/a> ratings and reviews, as well as individual app data on weather warnings, day views and ads. We then averaged this across both stores and gave each app a score out of 12 per metric. By calculating the total score, we have been able to rank the weather apps \u2013 and give you our Top 10.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/best-weather-apps.jpg\" alt=\"\\&quot;infographic\" width=\"\\&quot;854\\&quot;\" height=\"\\&quot;1133\\&quot;\" \/><\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Yahoo! Weather<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Not only is the Yahoo! Weather app visually pleasing, but it also hits our list at number 1. On the app you can see accurate hourly, 5-day and 10-day forecasts so you can plan in advance, and you will be notified if there is a weather warning. You don\u2019t have to worry about ads as this app is completely ad free.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Met Office <\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>It will come as no surprise that the Met Office app comes in at second place. The experts sure know how to create a helpful and accurate weather app. The only thing that lets this app down and stopped it from taking the number 1 spot is the lack of forward forecasts \u2013 you can only view weather 7 days in advance.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Weather &amp; Radar<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>With this app you can get accurate forecasts among other additions. You can see for 11 days in advance and the app gets a pretty good score across both app stores. The only downfall is that you do have to pay for the premium version \u2013 or you put up with the ads on the free version.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>AccuWeather<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This weather app is certainly popular \u2013 with over 1 million average reviews across app stores. It also offers forecasts for further ahead than any other app, showing a full 45-day forecast. It is however not ad free which is a big downfall for this app.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>The Weather Channel <\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The Weather Channel app gets good ratings across stores, offers an impressive 14 day forecast and is great for adverse weather conditions as it sends accurate weather warnings as notifications. Unfortunately, as with a few others, this app is not ad free \u2013 but if you can look past that it is a great choice.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<h2>Windy.com<\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The Windy.com app offers some pretty impressive visuals \u2013 with a great map animation and layers so you can see different weather forecasts. However, it doesn\u2019t have a large number of reviews just yet and unfortunately doesn\u2019t send weather warnings.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>BBC Weather<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The BBC Weather app may be lower down our list than you would expect, however unfortunately it doesn\u2019t receive a particularly high rating across app stores with an average of 4.5. This may be down to the fact it doesn\u2019t send weather warnings \u2013 however it does have a pretty impressive 14 day forecast and is easy to use.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"8\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Yr<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The Yr weather app offers a 10-day forecast, but unfortunately doesn\u2019t get the best reviews across the app stores. This app is ad free, so worth a try for yourself if you are curious.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"9\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Weather Live\u00ba<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>This app offers an 8-day forecast, with weather warnings. However, the lower score resulted from a low number of reviews across app stores, and it is unfortunately not ad free. However, there is a premium version which may be worth a try.<\/p>\n<ol start=\"10\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Hello Weather<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Hello Weather takes the final spot on our list. Coming in at number 10, this weather app is fairly new \u2013 with an average of 452 reviews across app stores. With this app, you\u2019ll get an 8 day forecast, no ads and a great design.<\/p>\n<p>We hope this list is helpful when planning your outings for the future whether you\u2019re an Apple or Android user.
