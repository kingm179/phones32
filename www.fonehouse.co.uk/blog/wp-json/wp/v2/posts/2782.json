It would not shock you to know that eCommerce websites keep their best deals on their websites! Fonehouse.co.uk is no different.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Should you buy an iPhone with no upfront cost?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Getting the best iPhone deal starts with doing a few checks. You need to make sure you get the right deal that fits with your lifestyle, location and activities. Here\u2019s a quick check list to find the best iPhone contract deal for you.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Network coverage<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Its an exciting time buying a new phone but you must check which network has the best coverage for your location.\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.ofcom.org.uk\/phones-telecoms-and-internet\/advice-for-consumers\/advice\/ofcom-checker\\\">Ofcom\u2019s network coverage checker<\/a>\u00a0shows you which network will work best for your location. Some networks may offer the best deals but won\u2019t always work when you want to make a call or check out Facebook. EE and Vodafone have the best coverage in the UK and most other networks piggyback off their service.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>What do you use your phone for?<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Everyone uses a mobile differently so understanding what you need is essential before you sign into a new contract. Here\u2019s a few questions you should ask yourself before you enter into a new contract phone deal.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>How many texts do I send a month?<\/li>\n<li>How many minutes do I use per month?<\/li>\n<li>How much mobile phone data do I use each month?<\/li>\n<li>Do I always have access to WIFI?<\/li>\n<li>What activities do I use my phone for?<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>If you are a heavy data user, then you will need a good data plan. This is where most of the cost is incurred on any mobile phone tariff. Most consumer packages now come with unlimited minutes and texts but if you don\u2019t really make a lot of calls then its worth checking out cheaper plans.<\/p>\n<p>Often its activities that dictate what phone we need.
