There\\&#8217;s a good reason that they are one of the top three designers and providers in the mobile phone industry. Getting an iPhone for yourself is an aspiration of many. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/apple-iphone-6s\\\">The iPhone 6s<\/a> is known to be an excellent choice, offering a lot of features despite being an older model.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">One of the things you might know about Apple products is that they can customise both the Lock Screen, which is the screen you first see when you use the phone and the Home Screen, which is the background of the phone when it\\&#8217;s in use.\u00a0 We\\&#8217;re going to show you how to change both of those right now.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Changing Your Wallpapers<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">First things first. You\u2019re going to need to have a wallpaper ready to use. That\u2019s not difficult to find &#8211; either take a photo that you want to use or go into the internet and find something that takes your fancy. Remember to make sure that you search for photos that work with the screen size of your phone. You can make sure you get the right dimensions by specifying \u201ciPhone 6S\u201d in the search results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Now that you\u2019ve done that, you\u2019re ready to go and change the wallpaper for your mobile device. A lot of people have two different photos or images on hand &#8211; one for their lock screen and then one for their home screen. Changing the designs on your phone is easy. You\u2019ll want to open the settings app and find the wallpaper function.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Once you\u2019ve done that, click follow the instructions to change your wallpaper. You can select one of the preset options, or you can pick out the image that you have chosen. Whatever you go for, you need to make sure that you have adjusted it to suit your specific needs and preferences. Hopefully, you\u2019ve taken the time to get an image that will fit the screen correctly; otherwise, you\u2019re going to have to make some sacrifices.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Once you\u2019ve got the amount in the shot that you want, you need to make sure that you click save and wait for a second. A notification will flash up and tell you that you have successfully changed the photo, and then either lock the phone or go to your home screen to look at the result.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It is pretty easy to make sure that you have properly changed your lock screen and home screen. They don\u2019t require a lot of effort to get right and at the same time can look stunning. It doesn\u2019t take a lot of time to sit down and figure out how to change your background, but you\u2019ll be thankful that you did. Thanks to the stunning graphics of the iPhone 6S, you\u2019ve got access to whatever you need in terms of backgrounds and wallpapers, so it becomes a simple task to find something incredible and turn it into your next backdrop.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple makes some of the best technology around.
