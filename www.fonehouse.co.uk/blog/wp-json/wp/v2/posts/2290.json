Technology has changed the way we interact with our world and the people that surround us. Fifteen years ago, having a regular mobile phone was enough to get around because we were using computers to do our web browsing and enjoy other online activities. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Social networks were in their infancy and there wasn\\&#8217;t really any pressure to get online. Fast forward to today and we have a completely different picture. People are literally gasping for air when their internet connection goes down. Seeing that new technology can get fairly expensive, we decided to review a simple Android phone from Alcatel that doesn\\&#8217;t cost much more than a feature phone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">If you own a modern smartphone, Alcatel Pixi 3 certainly won\u2019t blow you away with its design. There is nothing brash or flamboyant about it, it is just a small and simple polycarbonate shell designed to fit comfortably in your trousers. And talk about comfort, with dimensions of 112.2 x 62 x 11.9 mm, Pixi 3 feels like it disappeared in your pocket. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">For the first time in quite a while we were able to tie our shoes without cringing all the way through. Since the phone is fairly small by today\u2019s standards, handling it with one hand is incredibly simple and comfortable. In terms of details on body panels, there are three touch buttons on the front for navigating Android, power and volume buttons on the right side, and a slightly protruding camera on the back.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">A 3.5-inch TFT capacitive touchscreen pushing out 320 x 480 pixels was chosen to provide a pleasant experience in this price bracket. The screen does sound minute when compared to today\u2019s flagships, but just a couple of years ago Apple\u2019s iPhone 4 enjoyed incredible success with the same screen size. Transitioning from a larger screen might require some adaptation, but for those moving up from feature phones or from another entry-level device, Alcatel Pixi 3 will completely suffice.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Powering Pixi 3 is Mediatek\u2019s dual-core MT6572M CPU clocked at 1GHz with Mali-400 GPU and 512MB of RAM. Paired with Android 4.4 KitKat, this device is reasonably equipped for performing basic tasks both online and offline. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Browsing the web, staying in touch through social media, and reading up on emails will be much easier thanks to Google\u2019s vast app store. Nearly every popular service has a dedicated app, allowing much better interaction than using that same service through a mobile web browser. Even though Pixi 3 doesn\u2019t have Google\u2019s latest Android version, most apps are still compatible with KitKat. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">One thing to watch out for if you want to install a ton of apps is memory. The device has 4GB of on-board memory which can be expanded by 32GB using a microSD card. Pixi 3 also features a 2-megapixel main camera alongside VGA front camera. Both cameras are able to snap basic photos in good lighting conditions.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Alcatel Pixi 3 won\u2019t transform your world if you ever owned a smartphone, but if you didn\u2019t, it surely will. Moving from a feature phone to Android opens up a world of possibilities and the fact that Google\u2019s Play Store offers around 2.8 million apps is simply mindboggling. Even though you will only need a microscopic fraction of those apps, you\u2019ll be comforted by the fact that if you ever need something done, there is certainly an app for it!<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Today\\&#8217;s fast paced social environment is much different than the one we remember 15 years ago.
