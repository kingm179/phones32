Let\u2019s take a closer look and see whether Samsung can deliver on those promises.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In our usual fashion, we kick off with the design. There weren\u2019t any dramatic undertakings in the design department, meaning Ace 3 ended up looking like the rest of Galaxy series. It has a traditional, rounded-out shape accompanied by a chrome edge that we\u2019ve seen on previous models. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The back cover has changed a bit, as it doesn\u2019t have a slick surface any longer. In terms of size, Ace 3 has gotten slightly taller measuring 121.2 x 62.7 x 9.8 mm, but it has also gotten lighter by 7 grams coming in at 115 grams for the 3G version. All in all, it is still very comfortable to use and fits the hand perfectly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">On the front, you get a 4 inch TFT capacitive touchscreen bearing a resolution of 480 x 800 pixels and 233ppi density. Using it we\u2019ve noticed that the colors are pretty accurate with solid viewing angles. The only downside was screen brightness. It didn\u2019t perform so well as we expected it in direct sunlight.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In the performance department, we found a Dual-core 1 GHz Cortex-A9 for the 3G version and a slightly faster Dual-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A9 for the LTE version. Both versions have a Broadcom VideoCore IV GPU and 1GB of RAM. Running on Android 4.2, it performs well with most applications with minimal lag. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">If you plan to use it for checking emails and your social networks, watching videos and all that other good stuff, then you\u2019ll have no problems at all. Storage-wise, the two versions are different as well. 3G version has 4 GB of internal memory, while the LTE one has 8GB. Both versions have a microSD slot for storage expansion. Battery capacity is also different for the two versions, but both will last more or less a day.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Along with the aforementioned Android 4.2, you get Samsung\u2019s latest TouchWiz Nature UX interface. If you read some of our previous reviews of Samsung\u2019s devices, then you\u2019ll know what to expect. This version though, is scaled down to fit the performance figures. The features you\u2019ll be getting are S Travel, Smart Stay and S Translator. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It doesn\u2019t come with the animations found on more powerful models, but we aren\u2019t rubbing our eyes yet. An average user won\u2019t feel like anything is missing and that\u2019s what matters to us.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">A 5MP camera supplemented by an LED flash performs well enough in most situations. Samsung\u2019s interface packs plenty of features and adjustments to keep you fiddling. The phone\u2019s auto mode recognizes the setting accurately, leaving you with colorful and detailed images. Video recording can be done at 720p at 30fps.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Now that we\u2019ve seen everything, we have to draw up a conclusion. Spec-wise, Samsung Galaxy Ace 3 is a slight upgrade over the last year\u2019s model, but nothing spectacular that would make you chuck out your Ace 2 and run to the store. On the other hand, if you are considering and upgrade from the first Ace, you might just do that. Ace 3 has plenty of Samsung\u2019s features to keep you interested, while being a proficient all-rounder. As a lower end device then, we would definitely recommend taking a closer look because it met all our expectations.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Since most of us are already well familiar with Samsung\u2019s Galaxy Ace series, we\u2019re going to skip introductions and let you know that the series has just received its third installment, the Galaxy Ace 3. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3191,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"categories":[528],"tags":[40,135],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.3 -
