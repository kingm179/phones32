Whilst they also released a variety of new smartphones, they decided to make an improvement on last years too. Whilst keeping all the best features of the original P30 Pro, we get a few improved features too.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>High end design<\/h2>\n<p>Since Huawei rose to the join Apple and Samsung as the top three, we\u2019ve seen a very consistent high end design on the P range. Of course, that doesn\u2019t change when you get to the Huawei P30 Pro New Edition either. Of course, you get to enjoy the very classic all glass design, offering a glossy, expensive finish. This is probably one of the top features to create that high end design with any smartphone. They\u2019ve even used aluminosilicate glass to give you that added layer of protection with your smartphone. As always, we would always recommend purchasing a phone case just to make sure you\u2019re saving yourself money in the long run.<\/p>\n<p>All that is on the back of the phone is the camera set up in a very neat little housing and the Huawei logo. With so little featuring on the back, you get plenty of room for your chosen style to shine through. The Huawei P30 Pro New Edition is available in Black, Silver Frost and Aurora, each giving you a choice of personalities. If you want to stick with something very neutral and classic, the black option is perfect. Silver Frost allows you to keep hold of that high end feeling but add a bit of excitement. Meanwhile, Aurora gives you a pop of colour and really lets your style shine through.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst the back design of a phone is super important, the display needs to be just as impressive. That\u2019s why the New Edition has a 6.47 inch OLED display. Enjoy everything in the highest detail. You also get to enjoy the screen to the fullest with the selfie camera being transformed to a very small water drop notch at the top of the phone. Almost all of the edge bezels have been removed too!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Camera Set Up<\/h2>\n<p>Cameras are becoming more and more impressive in terms of what you can find on a smartphone. Huawei has been at the top of the smartphone camera game for quite some time now and it\u2019s easy to understand why. They even have a relatively large fanbase on Twitter who regularly share photos under different hashtags. On the back of the Huawei P30 Pro New Edition, you can find a quad lens camera and it packs a powerful punch. This camera consists of a 40MP wide lens, 8MP periscope telephoto lens, 20MP ultra wide camera and a TOF 3D sensor.<\/p>\n<p>Starting with the main lens, you\u2019re able to capture the world in high resolution with plenty of detail. This is the largest lens but also the one you\u2019re going to use the most. As it\u2019s just a regular lens, you get no special angles or shooting styles with it. Capture the world exactly as it is with this amazing high quality camera. Next in the set up is the periscope telephoto camera which can bring the world closer to you. Zoom right into different subjects without losing any detail. With this lens, you\u2019ll be able to see the world from a whole new angle.<\/p>\n<p>If you regularly take group photos or capture the scenery, the ultrawide camera is going to be your new best friend. This lens allows you to zoom out and shoot from a much wider frame. The best thing about it is you don\u2019t have to move at all. You don\u2019t have to worry about losing detail or having distorted photos as the camera system avoids that for you. Finishing off the system is the depth sensor. This is going to transform any portraits you take. Slowly, the background will be softened, which makes your subject burst out of the photo.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Huawei P30 Pro New Edition Prices<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes to the actual price of the Huawei P30 Pro New Edition, you\u2019re going to be pretty shocked. This smartphone comes in on all networks at a pretty low price. By releasing a whole new line of devices, you can get more up to date technology whilst keeping prices low.<\/p>\n<p>Here at Fonehouse, we will pair a lot of our deals with cashback offers to really bring the overall price down. These are both automatic and redemption amounts to allow you to save however suits you. If you aren\u2019t too bothered about making that overall cost lower but still want to save a bit, you\u2019ll find automatic cashback is perfect. This is a lower lump sum that we pay to you directly after 90 days. All that you need to do is make sure you\u2019re keeping up with your monthly bills and we handle the rest.<\/p>\n<p>Redemption cashback is for the people that want to save tons of money on their mobile phone contract. These amounts are always a lot higher than our automatic cashback. 5 separate times throughout your 24 month contract, you will need to submit a network bill and fill out a quick claim form. Once this has been received, we will process the claim and look to pay into your bank account. By the end of the contract, you should have the full amount.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now that you\u2019ve had a solid introduction to the Huawei P30 Pro New Edition, we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll be raring to get your hands on it.
