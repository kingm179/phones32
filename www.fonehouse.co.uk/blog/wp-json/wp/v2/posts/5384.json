There\u2019s an awful lot you\u2019re bound to love about this brand new handset, it\u2019s even got a super fun, new design! They\u2019ve even made two versions of the handset so you can decide between 5G or 4G when purchasing your contract.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s it look like?<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s not lying to say that one of the most important parts of any mobile phone is what it looks like. Without a super attractive design, people just aren\u2019t going to purchase it. Surprisingly, you\u2019ll get a plastic back with the S20 FE rather than an all glass experience. Either way, it offers a very attractive finish with an also satin design. There\u2019s also very little on the back, which means you\u2019re able to enjoy the full design to its full potential. The only things on the back are the Samsung logo and the camera system in a rectangular housing.<\/p>\n<p>With such a high finish on the back of the phone, you\u2019ll want to continue that with a great colour option. After all, there\u2019s so much room on the back so you may as well love it. If you want to stick with a very classic, understated colour, the Cloud White and Cloud Navy are perfect options. They\u2019re still incredibly attractive but have a more professional finish to them. For something a little more colourful, you can choose between the Cloud Mint, Cloud Lavender, Cloud Orange and Cloud Red options. All have the same high class finish with a pop of colour.<\/p>\n<p>So, the back of the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE already sounds like something that everyone could fall in love with. Sticking with the high quality from Samsung, it also has a very impressive display. You\u2019ll get to experience a 6.5 inch super AMOLED screen. The selfie camera has been reduced down to a tiny punch hole system whilst edge bezels have been removed to offer a much fuller view. Everything you view on this screen is going to show in a super high quality with more detail than ever before.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Outstanding Camera System<\/h2>\n<p>One thing that Samsung has been doing very well over the last year in particular is creating camera systems to love. On the back of the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE, you can find a triple lens camera that\u2019s capable of big things. Inside this system is a 12MP main camera, 8MP telephoto lens and a 12MP ultra wide camera. With huge thanks to the main camera, you\u2019ll be able to photograph the world in an extremely high quality fashion, even if there\u2019s not too much light around outside. Every single photo this camera captures will be full of detail, textures and real life colours.<\/p>\n<p>Next up in the S20 FE camera is the telephoto lens. This really is something to pay attention to as it allows you to capture photos in a whole new light. With this feature, you\u2019ll be able to access a number of different focal lengths. These allow you to zoom right in and capture details from further away. The best part is you get to keep the high resolution when doing so. To finish off the camera system is the ultra wide lens. We\u2019ve seen this a lot recently but it\u2019s easy to see why. When you want to capture more in your photos, you just need to switch to this lens as it offers a much larger frame to shoot in.<\/p>\n<p>Not only are you getting an impressive rear camera, but the Galaxy S20 FE also has a selfie camera that deserves to be talked about. Hiding in the tiny punch hole in the screen is a 32MP single lens. This is what is going to provide you the highest quality selfies you\u2019ve ever seen. Capture self portraits with huge amounts of colour and detail with this amazing, top tier feature.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Behind the brains of the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE<\/h2>\n<p>Whilst super high quality features, such as the camera and overall design, are super important, the things that make this phone running are by far the most important. Inside the Samsung Galaxy S20 FE is a 4500mAg battery unit and it\u2019s got some impressive power. On just one charge, this phone will allow you to go the entire day without the worry of a dead battery. When you do need to charge it up quickly, the phone supports fast charging 25W, fast wireless charging 15W, reverse wireless charging 4.5W and USE Power Delivery 3.0. Each addition is one that will make your life a whole lot easier.<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s also been a huge uplift in what people are keeping on their phones nowadays. More and more people are working, gaming or just storing a lot of data on their mobile phones. For that reason, the Samsung S20 FE is available in either 128GB or 256GB of internal memory. Both these options will allow you to keep a lot of detail on your phones however, there is also the chance to add more. The SIM slot also holds a microSD card so that you can slip a memory card in whenever you\u2019re running low.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>More to love<\/h2>\n<p>Nowadays, there are so many different ways you can gain access to your phone. From passcodes to fingerprint sensors to face recognition, we seem to be progressing very quickly. To keep up with the times, the Galaxy S20 FE has an under display, optical fingerprint sensor. This gives you super secure access to the mobile phone, a lot more secure than a passcode actually. As you can set a number of different fingerprints on the phone, you won\u2019t ever have to give out your passcode or risk it being memorised over your shoulder again.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Make sure you take a look at our <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-5g\\\">best Samsung Galaxy S20 FE deals<\/a> and pre order to be one of the first to get your hands on it.
