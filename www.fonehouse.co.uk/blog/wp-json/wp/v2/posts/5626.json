This is going to save you hundreds of pounds and make sure you don\u2019t have to pay out to fix your phone.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How do I get phone insurance?<\/h2>\n<p>Getting phone insurance is actually super simple! When you place an order through <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/\\\">fonehouse<\/a>, we\u2019ll give you the chance to add insurance to your order. All you need to do with this is make sure you select the insurance box and we\u2019ll handle the rest. You\u2019ll also be able to find the terms and conditions, which we suggest you do read before committing.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you decided not to add insurance or just forgot to select the insurance box, we can set you up with an insurance policy for up to 5 days after your phone has been delivered. In order to set it up, you must have the phone in your position and still in a perfect conditions. We will arrange this over the telephone to have confirmation of this on a recorded call.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Who insures my phone?<\/h2>\n<p>When you purchase a phone insurance policy through fonehouse, your phone will be insured with Warranty and Creditor Services. They\u2019re a leading mobile phone insurance company that make sure your phone stays safe. If you do ever need to make a claim, it\u2019s super easy and doesn\u2019t require too much work from yourself.<\/p>\n<p>To make a claim, you can call WCS on 01256 471387 or head over to wcsinsurance.co.uk and fill in a claim form. They pick up claims extremely quickly and can resolve insurance claims quickly.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What does it cover?<\/h2>\n<p>When you purchase your insurance policy through fonehouse with WCS Insurance, you\u2019ll be covered for a number of different accidents. You\u2019re covered for theft and accidental damage. This means that should your phone be stolen, WCS will replace it with a refurbished handset, the same as the one insured. If you damage the phone at all, they will repair it. If it is beyond repairable, you\u2019ll receive a refurbished phone to replace this. Your phone is also covered for your immediate family, which means if they damage your phone, it can still be fixed under warranty.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Purchasing phone insurance also gives you extended warranty, worldwide cover for 90 days a year and misuse of airtime of up to \u00a31000. Each of these little extras are great to have under your belt, just incase the worst thing imaginable happens!<\/p>\n<p>So, what isn\u2019t covered in this policy? You are not covered for loss. This also includes if you leave your phone in a public place, unattended and it is stolen, such as in your car, on a train or in a restaurant. This policy also doesn\u2019t cover misuse from yourself. If you put your phone in the washing machine, leave it on top of your car when driving or anything else of the type, you cannot get this fixed under warranty.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Are there any restrictions?<\/h2>\n<p>There aren\u2019t too many restrictions on this insurance policy with Warranty &amp; Creditor Services. One main restrictions is that you are limited to just 2 claims if your phone is stolen or damaged beyond repair. Each claim is recorded so more than two claims of the type will not be accepted.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Another key restriction is that if you claim on the insurance in the first 12 months, you must keep the insurance policy for another 12 months at the minimum. You may be subject to large charges if you cancel the insurance with WCS before the 12 month period after claiming.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>More things to know\u2026<\/h2>\n<p>We currently offer one months free insurance with all orders. You should be aware that after this free period, the service does not stop. You will be charged a monthly cost to cover the phone. This varies depending on the device you have insured.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Once you\u2019ve placed your order, we\u2019ll set up a direct debit to come out each month for you. This will be taken automatically so there\u2019s nothing you need to do. Direct debits will be taken from the same bank details that your phone bill come out of. If you cancel this direct debit, you will no longer be covered by WCS Insurance.<\/p>\n<p>If you are looking to cancel, you will need to contact WCS Insurance on admin@wcsinsurance.co.uk. We are not able to cancel the insurance for you as it is covered by a different company.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Didn\u2019t get phone insurance when you placed your order? Just give us a call on 0333 900 1133 ad we\u2019ll be able to point you in the right direction.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><!--vcv no format--><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Knowing all about your phone insurance is vital, especially if you want to make sure you\u2019re covered for all the most important accidents. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":5607,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"categories":[527],"tags":[198,324,495],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.3 -
