While this is fantastic news for you Brits abroad, it is still vitally important that you still read up on the terms and conditions that your chosen network have set out when it comes to data roaming.<\/p>\n<p>Fortunately, you have your reliable friends at Fonehouse to lay it out nice and clearly for you. Read on to find out all you need to know about using your smartphone abroad this summer\u2026<\/p>\n<h3><strong>EE<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>At Fonehouse we have some of the best\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/paymonthly\\\">EE deals<\/a><\/u>\u00a0out there on a range of fantastic phones.<\/p>\n<p>When you travel with an EE pay monthly contract, pay as you go SIM or even a tablet, you can use your roaming data free across the whole of the EU, meaning that any usage will come out of your contractual allowance as normal.<\/p>\n<p>When you choose an EE Max Plan, however, you can not only use your roaming in the EU but also in an additional 53 countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Mexico, Canada and the United States.<\/p>\n<p>So when you choose EE, you could quite literally be on the other side of the world and you wouldn\u2019t have to pay anything extra for getting in touch with friends and family back home or posting an Instagram picture to show them all the wonderful sites that you\u2019re seeing.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Vodafone<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Vodafone is one of the UK\\&#8217;s favourite networks, and at Fonehouse we\u2019re proud to bring you some of the very best\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/paymonthly\\\">Vodafone deals<\/a><\/u>\u00a0on the very best handsets.<\/p>\n<p>Travelling with Vodafone is now better than ever. On all of their plans (with the exception of Basic plans) you get free roaming in 152 destinations as part of your contractual allowance.<\/p>\n<p>On top of that when you choose to add on Roam Free to your contract, you can roam in an additional 48 countries, without paying an extra penny!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>IQ Mobile<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>IQ is Fonehouse\u2019s great SIM only network, offering the\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/IQ\\\">best SIM only deals<\/a><\/u>\u00a0from as little as \u00a34.99 per month. An IQ SIM only offer is fantastic if you love your existing handset, or if you don\u2019t want to take out a pricey pay monthly contract. You also only have to pay over 12 months, so if you change your mind in a year, you can either take out a new IQ contract or go for a different network and your hands on a great new handset.<\/p>\n<p>When travelling abroad with an IQ SIM in your smartphone, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that you get inclusive roaming as a part of your monthly allowance within the EU.<\/p>\n<p>However, if you\u2019re travelling outside the EU then you will need to be careful of when and where you use your roaming data, as charges will apply. Where you can it is best to use WIFI, and when you do use your roaming data, always remember to turn it off again when you are finished &#8211; you don\u2019t want any unpleasant surprises on your bill at the end of the month!<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for a new smartphone before you go on your travels this summer, then why not check out Fonehouse\u2019s incredible range of\u00a0<u><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/best-mobile-phone-deals\\\">Summer Deals<\/a><\/u>.
