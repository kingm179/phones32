Samsung revealed their 4 new major handsets to the next S20 range; the Galaxy S20,\u00a0 Galaxy S20 5G, Galaxy S20+ 5G and the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g\\\">Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>The need for a waterproof phone is constantly growing. Whether you worry about your phone in the rain, or you\u2019re one for dropping them in toilets, water resistance an important factor when buying a new phone. Tech-giants Samsung have designed all their high-end smartphones<\/p>\n<p>Looking for the best Samsung Galaxy S20 deals? <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-s20-4g\\\">View deals<\/a><\/p>\n<h2>How long can the S20 series stay under water?<\/h2>\n<p>Each addition to the S20 series is resistant in water for up to 30 minutes. Any longer means seals may begin to lift and water damage will be inevitable. The newly announced phones are, however, completely resistant to dust.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not guaranteed that your phone will completely break should you keep it in the water any long. We wouldn\u2019t suggest testing this as any warranty won\u2019t cover such damage and you may be forced to pay for the damage yourself.<\/p>\n<h2>How deep under the water can the S20 series go?<\/h2>\n<p>The S20 range is water resistant in up to 1.5 metres. Any deeper than this and the water pressure could cause some serious damage.<\/p>\n<p>Overall, you will be more than fine taking photos next to the pool whilst on holiday or walking places in the heights of a storm. We wouldn\u2019t suggest pushing it too far though!<\/p>\n<h2>What is the IP rating?<\/h2>\n<p>An IP rating is the code given to technology to classify it\u2019s level of protection against dust and water. IP, or ingress protection, is always followed by two numbers. The first being against dust and the second against water. The S20 range has an IP68 rating. This is the highest possible level of dust and water protection among current market leading phones.<\/p>\n<p>The digit 6 means the device is completely \u2018dust-tight-. The digit 8 means the phone is suitable for immersion in up to 1.5 metres of water.<\/p>\n<p>All 5 of the phones announced by Samsung follow the same specs when it comes to their water resistance. If you decide to stick with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-5g\\\">Samsung Galaxy S20+<\/a> or take a chance on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-s20-5g\/essential-plan-25gb-63-new-5g\\\">Samsung Galaxy S20 5G<\/a>, you will receive the same level of protection against the elements!<\/p>\n<p>The S20 range has an IP68 rating. This is the highest possible level of dust and water protection among current market leading phones. You can rest assured that your phone will withstand 30 minutes in water up to 1.5m deep with no issues.<\/p>\n<h2>Is the Samsung Galaxy S20 waterproof?<\/h2>\n<p>The most important factor to answering this question is to remember that water resistant does not mean waterproof. Manufacturers don\u2019t currently have the ability or information to make a smartphone completely waterproof.<\/p>\n<p>Whether you decide to go for the lower priced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-s20-4g\\\">Samsung Galaxy S20<\/a> or the high-end Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G, you can be assured you are receiving the highest level of protection available. With an IP68 rating, this range has been designed to withstand a fair amount of dust and water.<\/p>\n<p>All phones are only water resistant to a certain point so don\u2019t try pushing the boundaries with a deep-sea dive! You wouldn\u2019t want to risk damaging your part of the new Samsung series.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yesterday, Samsung revealed the new addition to their ever-growing brand, but is the Samsung S20 series waterproof?
