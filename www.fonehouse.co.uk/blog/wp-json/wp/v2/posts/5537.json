To be honest, it\u2019s not all that different. There\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with modified stock and to be honest, it helps us give you a lower price on your contract. The best thing about it is you\u2019re still getting the quality.<\/p>\n<h2>What is modified stock?<\/h2>\n<p>Modified stock is Samsung products that are sourced from Europe to use in the UK. Other than that, there\u2019s not much difference. You don\u2019t have to lose out on any sort of quality. In terms of design, use and specification, everything stays the same. Every single unit of modified stock we receive is inspected and modified by authorised partners to make it suitable to use in the UK. We cannot buy modified stock from anyone other than Samsung authorised partners in order to sell it in the UK. With that in mind, you can relax knowing that Samsung approved the sale of these items, proving that there\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with them.<\/p>\n<h2>Where does modified stock come from?<\/h2>\n<p>We purchase modified stock from Samsung\u2019s authorised partners. This comes from Europe and allows us to offer you lower prices. Samsung has a full list of their authorised partners on their website if you wish to see. To ensure that every single customer is getting the quality they deserve, we are not allowed to sell modified stock from anyone but these authorised parters. Most third parties also use these authorised retailers to get their Samsung stock as well. Overall, it works out a lot better for the customer in terms of price.<\/p>\n<h2>Why is it modified stock?<\/h2>\n<p>We call this modified stock because it was originally created to use in Europe. This means it came with a different charger and different firmware. That is the only difference between the two. Authorised partners will buy this then replace the European plus for a UK mains three pin plug. They\u2019ll also make sure that the UK firmware is available on the phone. This is all done following strict guidelines set by Samsung. Other than this, you don\u2019t have many differences between European and UK sourced stock. Modified stock is also a lot cheaper than UK sourced stock too!<\/p>\n<h2>Why do you buy modified stock?<\/h2>\n<p>By purchasing modified stock, we can offer our customers much lower prices. This allows them to save huge amounts of money on their mobile phone contracts. You\u2019ll notice that our Samsung deals are a lot cheaper than others on the market. This is because we have purchase modified stock to offer lower prices. There is no different between the two kinds apart from the price. All handsets are brand new and come with full manufacturer warranty. So you really don\u2019t miss out on anything.<\/p>\n<h2>Will I get original accessories with modified stock?<\/h2>\n<p>You will get an official UK mains charging plug included in the package. All other accessories are the original products. When we purchase this Samsung stock, we will change the charging plug. This is originally received with a European plug because it\u2019s manufactured for the EU. You will still receive the original charging cable as well as any other accessories available.<\/p>\n<p>Now that you know all about modified stock, we\u2019re sure that you won\u2019t be obverse to it.
