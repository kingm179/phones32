As it turns out, we were ready indeed and demand for Note series smartphones skyrocketed. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">During its second year on the market, Note series acquired all the traits of a proper flagship and remained there ever since. As a result, Samsung was left with 2 flagship lines; Galaxy S series usually showcased every spring and Note series showcased every fall. In 2013 it became clear that most innovations are being introduced on the Note series and trickled down to other products eventually. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">By taking on that role, Note series not only became a testing ground for new technology, but also a key product for Samsung and the entire smartphone industry. Let\u2019s take a closer look at this year\u2019s innovations!<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Since Note series smartphones reside in flagship territory, design and build quality are on top of the list. Being a phablet, Note 4 has rather bulky dimensions compared to regular smartphones. Main reason behind it is the massive 5.7-inch screen around which all other components are built. Dimensions come out at 153.5 x 78.6 x 8.5 mm, weighing in at 176 grams. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Besides being large, Note 4 is beautifully crafted with loads of tiny details to make it stand out. It brings back the same \u201cleather\u201d back cover seen on Note 3. Using polycarbonate instead of leather is infinitely more practical in terms of durability. The metallic rim has been replaced by more modern metallic edges that won\u2019t fade as easy as the previous solution.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">As we mentioned above, Note 4 packs a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED screen firing off a resolution of 1440 x 2560 pixels resulting in 515ppi density. Words fail to describe the impression we first got. Immersing yourself into the gigantic screen can be considered visual heaven. Colors have a stunning richness to them, contrast is planets apart and screen brightness will outshine the sun on the sunniest of days. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In case you don\u2019t like how everything looks, you can select a different display mode, similar to what you can do on modern TVs. It\u2019s a great way to customize your screen and get the colors just the way you want them to be. High resolution makes for a tremendous viewing experience by creating crystal clear images which are absolutely hard to believe.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Under the hood Note 4 packs Qualcomm\u2019s latest chipset. It\u2019s the bone-crushing, physics defying quad-core Snapdragon 805 clocked at 2.7 GHz backed by Adreno 420 GPU and 3GB of RAM. Needless to say, Note 4 will blow anything you throw at it straight out of the water. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It is so powerful that even the latest games run on full blast without any traces of lag. It\u2019s worth mentioning that the new core offers not only better performance but also emits less heat under heavy loads. Comparing Note 3 to Note 4 while gaming, one can see distinct progress. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Heat emissions are almost unnoticeable on the new model even while recording ultra-resolution videos and during heavy gaming sessions. All benchmark tests show that Note 4 is one of the fastest devices on the market today. Built-in memory amounts to 32GB, but it is expandable up to 128GB via a microSD card.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">On the back, Note 4 packs a 16-megapixel camera aided by LED flash. The sensor is unbelievably quick and agile in all conditions. Snapping photos takes mere milliseconds in well-light areas. In darker areas you might need a second or two for the lens to adjust and turn on the flashlight if deemed necessary. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Resulting photos have unbelievable clarity, accurate colors and spectacular levels of detail. As a bonus, Samsung included tons of settings for those looking to squeeze out every ounce of performance from the camera.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Like every year, Note series produced a device representing the pinnacle of\u00a0<\/span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">smartphone design and technology. Galaxy Note 4 came a long way since the original Note, refining every single component and feature to perfection, particularly the S Pen. If you don\u2019t mind the size, Note 4 impresses on so many levels leaving you with a huge grin on your face.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Couple of years ago, Samsung introduced the Note series as an experiment to showcase new technologies and test out waters to see whether the world was ready for big screen smartphones.
