Whether that\u2019s a premium sophisticated design, advanced camera system, first-class display or maybe all of those features combined -well at least that&#8217;s the case for the HONOR Magic4 Pro. This flagship handset has been a highly anticipated one, and we at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/\">Fonehouse<\/a> were lucky enough to get our hands on one early. We\u2019ve selected three stand-out features of the handset, put them to the test, recorded the result and even added a top tip in there as a bonus. Your decision on whether to take the plunge and get this new HONOR handset made easy.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Feature 1: First-Time Combination First-Class Display<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There\u2019s a lot of hype surrounding the HONOR Magic4 Pro 6.81\u201d 120Hz adaptive LTPO OLED display. Some phrases that have been thrown out there to describe it are: \u201ctruly immersive\u201d \u201cexclusive\u201d and \u201cfirst-class\u201d. On paper this display seems pretty cool, I mean it&#8217;s quad-curved designed, has a DCI-P3 wide colour gamut and is IMAX ENHANCED certified. Hmm seems pretty impressive right?<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Feature 1 Test: <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What\u2019s the one thing we pretty much all do on our devices? Stream entertainment content of course! I headed to the likes of Youtube and Netflix to see if the HONOR Magic4 Pro display really brings visuals to life or not.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Feature 1 Result:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10403\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My first stop was Youtube to check out the trailer for the new Avatar: The Way of Water film due to be released later this year. The first thing I noticed was how beautifully in-depth the colours were on the screen. The deepest blues, browns and greens were featured paired with an impressive crystal clear quality. From this test, it\u2019s obvious that the DCI-P3 wide colour gamut and IMAX enhanced certification features are paying off. This experience was like a mini-cinema in the palm of my hand. The \u201ctruly immersive\u201d statement is true after all.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Feature 1 Tip:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With a screen as flawless as this, you need to make the most of all things entertainment. So my top tip would be to watch a big blockbuster on the handset! The quad-curved design in particular really does elevate the typical viewing experience so you\u2019ll be in for a treat.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Feature 2: Ultra Fusion Photography<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The advanced camera system behind the HONOR Magic4 Pro has been noted to be one of the handset&#8217;s top stand-out features. With this triple-lens setup (consisting of a 50MP wide lens, a 50MP ultra-wide lens and a 64MP Periscope Telephoto lens), users can effortlessly capture what they see, enjoy HDR photography due to a superior lens, and even enjoy a spectacular night mode.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Feature 2 Test:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I was curious to see if the HONOR Magic4 Pro camera was all it was made up to be, so I did the logical thing and explored the great outside with it (and by outside I mean I went for a fancy breakfast and snapped some pics of my food). Were the photos remarkably perfect and most importantly Instagram worthy? Well, keep scrolling to find out.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Feature 2 Result:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_110312-3-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10393\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_110312-3-150x113.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_110312-3-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_110312-3-400x300.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_110312-3-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_110312-3-800x600.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_110312-3-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_110312-3-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_110312-3-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_110312-3-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>I was impressed with the HONOR Magic4 Pro\u2019s photography power. Not only were all the beautiful fine details picked up thanks to the \u2018Advanced 7P Wide Camera\u2019, but my shots were completely stable every time thanks to the handsets Flicker Sensor.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1024x768.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10394\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_141954-5-150x113.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_141954-5-300x225.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_141954-5-400x300.jpg 400w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_141954-5-768x576.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_141954-5-800x600.jpg 800w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/IMG_20220521_141954-5-2048x1536.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from snapping photos of food as you can see from above, I did capture some photos of sceneries too. Again this HONOR device pulled through with its HDR photography and 122\u00b0 field of view on the Ultra Wide Angle lens, to give me incredible high-quality photos. In my book, this camera is definitely Instagram approved.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Feature 2 Tip:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In regards to this feature, my top tip is to actually get up and leave your house for once! The HONOR Magic4 Pro camera is simply too good to be sitting inside all day. Get up, explore and take wonderful photos along the way.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Feature 3 GPU Turbo X: <\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s start off with the basics, what actually is GPU Turbo X? GPU Turbo X uses AI rendering which enables your smartphone to keep high-quality visuals on-screen whilst lowering energy consumption at the same time. Included frame rate boosting technology paired with this consumption adjustment factor also enhances battery life and ultimately aims to improve the overall gaming experience. It\u2019s time to put this cool feature to the test.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Feature 3 Test:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay so the method I took for this test is pretty obvious, I headed to the Google Play Store and downloaded a game -big shock I know. The particular game, I trialed out was \u2018Race Master 3D- Car Racing\u2019 for the lengthy duration of two hours.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Feature 3 Result:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image alignfull size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" src=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-1024x682.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-10404\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-150x100.jpg 150w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/05\/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The effects of the GPU Turbo X feature were clearly evident to me. Despite gaming for a solid two hours straight the battery life on the HONOR Magic4 Pro remained consistently high, and the graphics were continually top-quality. Compared to gaming on other handsets, I found gaming on this device more hands-on, and the experience as a whole was more immersive and addictive (hence gaming for two hours straight). So if you\u2019re a gaming fanatic out there you\u2019re in luck, this HONOR handset is bound to elevate your experience to levels you\u2019ve never reached before.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Feature 3 Tip:<\/strong><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe you\u2019re an avid gamer and you already know all the hit games, but if you\u2019re not I suggest you do some research on what\u2019s popular right now in the world of Andriod gaming. Find a pick and try it out for yourself on the HONOR Magic4 Pro. See for yourself if it&#8217;s worth all the hype (big spoiler: it most definitely is).&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>After reading all the ins and outs regarding the features the HONOR Magic4 Pro has to offer from its beautiful large display to its remarkable photography power, I&#8217;m sure you\u2019ll want to find the best money-saving deal too right?
