People mistakenly think that they will be saving money by staying on pay as you go however as soon as you start topping up more than \u00a320 a month you could definitely save money on a pay monthly deal.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\u00a0<\/span>This comes as a surprise to many people who assume that pay monthly phones always cost \u00a330 plus a month but we have managed to collect some really <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Paymonthly\\\">great cheap contract phones with no upfront cost from our favourite networks<\/a>, EE and Vodafone.<\/p>\n<h3>No Upfront Cost?<\/h3>\n<p>Yes, you read that correctly! \u00a0You can get a really great cheap contract phone with the added bonus of not having to pay anything upfront for the privilege.<\/p>\n<p>Branded a free phone all that happens is the network absorb the cost of the handset into the contract and sometimes take some of the hit themselves because they are keen to get your business. This means that you have an even wider choice of handset for a really great monthly fee.<\/p>\n<h3>Stick to Your Allowance<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The one thing we will say about any contract phone is that understanding and staying within the limits of your tariff is vital.<\/p>\n<p>The charges that will be levied by networks for going over contract terms can be quite significant so make sure that you do not skimp on what you need otherwise your seemingly cheap contact will end up costing you more each month than you actually planned for. To avoid any surprise charges make sure you understand restrictions on calling things like premium rate numbers.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\u00a0<\/span>If you travel a lot or have family and friends outside of the UK you also need to check how international calling works as this is another hidden cost if you are not aware of the rules. EE currently have a great offer on some of their contracts that includes an extra international calling plan so have a look at each deal carefully before signing up.<\/p>\n<h3>Check Out Different Handsets<\/h3>\n<p><\/p>\n<p style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">While everyone raves about the market<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Samsung-Galaxy-S9\\\"> leading phones like the Samsung Galaxy S9<\/a> and the iPhone X, to be fair you are in part paying for a name.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\u00a0<\/span>While there is no arguing that these phones are the high end excellence of mobile phone technology there are plenty of other phones out there that do not have the same pretty price tag attached.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\u00a0<\/span>People tend to avoid these handsets because they haven\u2019t heard of them but this could be a huge oversight. \u00a0Check out the feedback on many of our other handsets and you will see that there is a wealth of unrecognised brilliance out there.<\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\u00a0<\/span>Nearly all smartphones have a set of capabilities and you do not need to head to the top to get a phone that offers what you need. \u00a0Cameras, video streaming, apps, and more are all features of many handsets from brands like LG, Sony and Huawei and in some cases these give the big players a run for their money. So if you are looking for a cheap contract phone you may want to have a look at some of these.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Saving money is really important to many people which is why mobile phones are often overlooked.
