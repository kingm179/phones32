Tech giants, Sony, are releasing 3 new handsets in 2020 and each one of them is built with some amazing bits.<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/brand\/sony-mobile-phone-deals\\\">Sony<\/a> Xperia 1 II will be released in early summer 2020, unlike the other two releases arriving at the end of April. This is Sony\u2019s new 5G flagship smartphone, catapulting them forward with the new technology and opening up the market.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Flawless Design<\/h2>\n<p>You\u2019ll be able to purchase the Xperia 1 II in two sleek colours: Black and Purple. Sony have decided to stick with their very neutral yet professional design and once again, have tackled this very well. They\u2019ve also chosen to go for a larger 21:9 CinemaWide 6.5\u201d display with very slim bezels for the selfie camera to tuck into. The triple lens camera has been neatly tucked into the top left corner on the back of the phone, well out of the way.<\/p>\n<p>Although you get a bigger screen this phone stays super slim, allowing really easy one-handed operation so you don\u2019t need to struggle. You\u2019ll also notice that you can multitask on the Xperia 1 II. The CinemaWide display lets you split the screen not two parts so you can do two things at once. Text your friends whilst you watch your favourite videos so you never miss out again. This longer screen also means that you don\u2019t need to scroll to see more of what you love.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>All the cool bits<\/h2>\n<p>These are the features that everyone\u2019s here for. People want to know exactly what they can do with their phones, even if they don\u2019t ever use some of the features! There are some really cool features from the Sony Xperia 1 II ranging from the camera to colour reproduction to audio.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re a lover of wired headphones, you can still make use of them as Sony are still clinging on to their 3.5mm audio jack. For anyone who makes use of the Xperia 1 II audio, you will not be disappointed. This smartphone has been built with high-resolution audio, 360 reality audio, true front stereo speakers and Dolby Atmos. All these features, and more, working together will give you cinema like, surround sound at a super high resolution. You\u2019ll be able to completely immerse yourself in sound.<\/p>\n<p>For those who are regularly taking photos of everything they love, you may want to sit down. The Sony Xperia 1 II packs a serious punch in the camera area. Engineers working on the Alpha 9 camera series sat down to work on the smartphone camera. That means, you\u2019re getting a digital camera straight from your mobile. Make use of industry-leading Eye Autofocus to get some of the best photos you\u2019ve ever taken. The sensor working very closely with the camera allows you to focus on moving objects with more detail then you\u2019ve ever seen. For super precise, detailed photos, this comes in handy.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s under the bonnet?<\/h2>\n<p>Unsurprisingly, this is one high powered, extremely fast phone. 5G connectivity paired with Wi-Fi 6, a powerful battery and a legendary processor means the Xperia 1 II sets a whole new level of speed for tech devices. As this phone is built to be 5G compatible, you\u2019ll receive some of the fastest upload and download speeds you\u2019ve ever seen before. Streaming and resolutions will also be a lot better than you\u2019ve ever had before.<\/p>\n<p>Sony have built the Xperia 1 II with Android 10 so you\u2019ll get the most recent updates along with all your favourite Google apps. Android isone of the favourites when it comes to operating systems and it\u2019s fairly obvious as to why. With only one memory option, 256GB, Sony have also opted to include expandable storage of up to 1 TB through a microSDXC. This is perfect for all those who tend to work from their phone, regularly game or even just have a lot of photos!<\/p>\n<p>A huge component to making this phone as good as it is, the 4000mAh non-removable Li-Po battery. This battery packs some serious power and can keep your phone up and running longer than ever before. For those times you do need a quick boost, fast charging and wireless charging are compatible.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Your Perfect Sony Xperia 1 II Deal<\/h2>\n<p>With hundreds of deals available, we\u2019re sure you\u2019ll find the perfect deal for you.
