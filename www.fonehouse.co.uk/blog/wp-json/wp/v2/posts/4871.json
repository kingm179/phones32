Both offer smartphones with very similar components but they also have differences that push them above each other. Specific perks such as prices, cameras, even fan bases can make one handset more appealing when you\u2019re searching for a phone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Perks of Honor devices<\/h2>\n<p>The biggest perk of choosing any of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/brand\/honor-mobile-phone-deals\\\">Honor handsets<\/a> is that they do tend to be cheaper than Huawei phones. This is purely down to the fact that they don\u2019t have as much of a following as Huawei therefore, people are paying for the quality over the brand. Just by taking a closer look at any Honor device, you can see that they\u2019re full of great parts and interesting features. You\u2019ll also be able to get all this with a rather fun and unique design.<\/p>\n<p>To put your mind at rest, Honor is actually an offcut of Huawei. These devices very closely follow Huawei releases with what they hold. Essentially, you\u2019re paying for a cheaper Huawei handset! The processors, operating systems and batteries have all been previously seen in Huawei handsets.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>The Best of Huawei<\/h2>\n<p>Most of Huawei\u2019s fanbase will agree that one of the best features of any <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/brand\/huawei-mobile-phone-deals\\\">Huawei<\/a> handset is the camera. If there\u2019s one thing Huawei does better than anyone else, it\u2019s make camera systems. Each Huawei camera has a collection of very strong lenses, backed by some great features. Huawei even has a trending hashtag on Twitter with everyone\u2019s favourite photos from their Huawei\u2019s.<\/p>\n<p>As Huawei is a much bigger brand with a far larger following, you\u2019ll be able to find accessories in more shops than Honor devices. This includes phone cases, screen protectors and even charging wires. This means you won\u2019t have to settle for what you can find. You can be sure that there will be a range of different colours, patterns and textures. As Honor is a much smaller brand, you\u2019re likely to have to settle with whatever you can find, which can be a big put off for other people.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Honor VS Huawei<\/h2>\n<p>There really is no clear winner of this fight of Honor VS Huawei, it\u2019s entirely down to personal preferences. If you\u2019re looking for something cheap and cheerful, Honor may just be for you! Anyone looking for something a little more high end may want to turn towards a Huawei handset.<\/p>\n<p>One thing that devices have in common is that you will be able to find high end, mid tier and lower tier handsets available. These all get updated each year to ensure they\u2019re able to keep their fan base up to date with the latest technology. Whilst Huawei have larger releases, you can still be sure to hear about the yearly releases from Honor too.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>No matter which side you\u2019re on in the Honor VS Huawei war, both will have the perfect addition for you. There are a whole range of different Honor and Huawei devices so you can find the one that best suits your needs.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\u2019s always hard to decide which smartphone you should buy next but it\u2019s especially for those deciding their side in the Honor VS Huawei war.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4851,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"categories":[527],"tags":[166,175],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.3 -
