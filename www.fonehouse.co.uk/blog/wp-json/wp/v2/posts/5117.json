There can be hundreds of reasons as to why calls drop. Some reasons are even specific to different phones. One thing you can be certain of is if your calls keep dropping, there\u2019s a problem that needs solving. Lucky for you, we\u2019ve taken a look into why calls drop and how to stop it.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Reasons for drops calling<\/h2>\n<p>One of the most popular common reasons for calls dropping is due to dead zones. This is when you\u2019re in a particular place that is a little further away from cellular towers or surrounding my objects that block the signals from coming through. Most commonly, these will be in places with little people living, such as the Highlands. This is purely down to the fact that there are less towers in the area. A lot of places, such as the underground and built car parks may also not have much signal. This is because there are large objects blocking the signal from coming through.<\/p>\n<p>In a lot of buildings, you may notice that your signal has seriously dropped, even though it\u2019s perfectly fine outside. A lot of the time, this is due to the materials the building is actually made with. Materials such as reinforced concrete and even some types of insulations can cause lower signals inside. This is far more common in larger buildings as compared to homes. Going outside to answer a call is a huge inconvenience and is especially bad when it\u2019s not such great weather outside. Being in the UK, that\u2019s more often than not.<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re sure there\u2019s no issue with the signal, then it may actually be your mobile that\u2019s causing the issues. You can make sure this is the issue by noting when your calls are dropping, if it\u2019s anywhere at any time, it\u2019s most likely your phone. If it\u2019s in particular places or at a particular time, it\u2019s probably something to do with the signal. When your mobile is smashed up, gone through water damage or just not very looked after, the antenna may actually be damaged, causing dropped calls. Even if you don\u2019t have the latest software update, this may be causing issues!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How to solve this<\/h2>\n<p>There isn\u2019t really too much you can do about dead zones when it comes to your calls dropping. To solve it continually, there would need to be more cell towers built, which isn\u2019t cost efficient. If your call is urgent, you should either come out of the built up area to a more open space or move closer to a town\/city to reach signals. Alternatively, there are now boosters you can use to extend how far the signal is going. You could always take a look at different networks to find the one with the best signal in your area too.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, once a building is built, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to rip it down and make it with materials that allow phone signals. Whilst it\u2019s a huge inconvenience, it also wouldn\u2019t make sense economically. If you want to get signals in buildings such as these, you\u2019re going to need a signal booster. These will make sure that your calls can be taken inside by projecting the cellular signals inside the building. A lot of people even use such devices to push Wi-Fi signals further around their house.<\/p>\n<p>First of all, you\u2019re going to want to make sure your phone is charged and updated with the latest software. Should that not help, you\u2019re best off getting someone to take a look at your phone and see if there\u2019s an issue with it. You may be able to come to some sort of agreement and arrange repair of the phone if possible. If the phone just isn\u2019t able to be fixed, they may try and help you find something similar for a great price to make sure you can stay connected.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Why do my calls keep dropping?<\/h2>\n<p>Of course, there are ways to check with the above reasons and they\u2019re pretty simple to solve. However, there is one last reason that may answer the question you keep asking yourself, \u2018Why do my calls keep dropping?\u2019 Well, if it\u2019s not a damaged phone, a dead one or weak signals, it may be a problem with the handoff between towers. If you\u2019ve answered a call on the move and are continuing to move, the signals need to jump between towers. Sometimes, the towers have handoff issues which cause your calls to drop. It\u2019s not a huge issue though.<\/p>\n<p>Solving this issue is actually pretty simple. A lot of the time, you\u2019ll be able to call the number back and not worry about it dropping again. In some cases, if it happens a lot, investing in a mobile phone signal booster will help a lot. This will allow you to direct the signal from the tower to your phone and take calls with no worries.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, you\u2019ll no longer be asking yourself, \u2018Why do my calls keep dropping?\u2019 If the problem continues, it may be a case that you need to invest in a new smartphone. Overtime, your device may deteriorate, especially if you\u2019ve had it for quite some time.
