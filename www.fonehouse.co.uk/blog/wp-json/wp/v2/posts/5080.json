Lucky for you, it\u2019s not actually as hard as you many have thought. Blocking contacts has never been so easy. You can completely block out a person and never have to deal with them again, and here\u2019s how.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Reasons to block numbers<\/h2>\n<p>There are thousands of reasons as to why you may find yourself wanting to block a number. Whether you\u2019ve had a nasty falling out, entered your number somewhere strange or just keep receiving loads of spam calls, there\u2019s a way to reduce your stress. Blocking numbers can really clear up your phone, allowing you to enjoy it without having contact from different people throughout the day. When you finally decide that you want to let them back into your life, simply unblock the number.<\/p>\n<p>Blocking any number on your Android is going to stop them from being able to call, text and video call you. Whether they\u2019re someone you chatted to lots, someone you never spoke to or even a saved contact, they will not be able to contact you. Whilst some networks can actually block spam calls and no caller id numbers, others require you to block each number individually.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>How to block a number on Androids<\/h2>\n<p>On an Android device, there isn\u2019t actually a list of numbers that are blocked hidden away in your settings. With iPhones, you\u2019re able to see every single contact that is blocked in your settings. These are then removed from the contact list. With Androids, any blocked contacts will still appear in your contact book.<\/p>\n<p>When you actually want to block a contact, it\u2019s one of the most simple things to do. Simply head into your contact list and scroll down to the contact you would like to block. If you\u2019re receiving spam calls, you will need to save these as contacts before blocking them. This is the same as no caller ID numbers. Once your contact is saved, you can click into it and tap the three dots in the top right. From here, select \u2018Block Number\u2019 and your number will be blocked. From now on, these people will no longer be able to contact you.<\/p>\n<p>With no caller ID contacts, you obviously cannot save them in your contact book. There\u2019s no available number to add. If you do want to block no caller IDs, you can save a contact with the number \u201900000 000000\u2019 This will mean that anyone using no caller ID will no longer be able to contact you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Removing the Block<\/h2>\n<p>Taking a contact off block is just as easy as putting one on. To unblock a contact, all you need to do is head back into your phone\u2019s contact list. Scroll down until you can find the contact you\u2019re wanting to unblock. Tap into the contact and select the three dots in the top corner. With a list of drop down options, select \u2018Unblock Number\u2019. From there, this contact will now be able to call, text and video call at all times of the day. Of course, you will be able to block these contacts again later on.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Will they know I\u2019ve blocked them?<\/h2>\n<p>Shortly and simply, no. Anyone you block will not receive a notification letting them know they are blocked. Instead, they will not be able to get through to you on the phone. Each time they call, they will be sent directly to voicemail. You\u2019ll get a message to let you know a voicemail has been left; however, these will fall into a separate folder so that you don\u2019t have to listen to them.<\/p>\n<p>When it comes to texts, it will look as if they were sending. No texts will come through to your phone so it will just look as if you\u2019re not replying to texts. Alternatively, they may also think that you aren\u2019t receiving their texts, which could make your next meeting way easier.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now that you\u2019re an expert on how to block a number on Androids, you\u2019ll be able to remove any unwanted contact from your life.
