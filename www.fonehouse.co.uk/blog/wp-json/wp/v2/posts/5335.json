We offer two different types of cashback so that you\u2019re able to choose the perfect pairing for you. Automatic cashback is the simplest form of cashback however, you\u2019re not going to get as large savings as our other method. This is paid to you in lump sum after 90 days of your contract being live. All you need to do is ensure that you\u2019re paying the bills to the network on time, we\u2019ll handle the rest.<\/p>\n<p>For extremely large savings, you\u2019re going to want to turn to redemption cashback. These amounts are always a lot larger than automatic. We make sure redemption amounts allow for larger savings as you do in fact have to claim for them. Over the course of your 24 month contract, you\u2019ll be asked to claim for the cashback in 5 separate instalments. Claiming is so simple as all you need to do is submit your monthly bill along with a super quick form. Once we\u2019ve received this, we\u2019ll get ready to pay you in the next few days..<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Now that you know where to find all the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-a51\\\">best Samsung Galaxy A51 deals<\/a>, we\u2019re sure you won\u2019t come out with a bad price.
