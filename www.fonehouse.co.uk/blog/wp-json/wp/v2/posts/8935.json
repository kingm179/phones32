Research shows that actually Black Friday is the most popular time for people to search for a new phone \u2013 even beating Christmas and January Sales. In the UK, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/black-friday-phone-deals\">Black Friday<\/a> shopping is still a relatively new phenomenon. It first appeared in the UK in 2010, when Amazon ran a Black Friday sale, and it has grown ever since.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>What was once confined to one day only (in addition to Cyber Monday, of course) now spans the majority of November. This means, you don\u2019t even have to wait for the big day anymore you can bag a bargain before Black Friday in some cases!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday at Fonehouse<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It should come as no surprise that we wanted to get in on the Black Friday action as early as possible \u2013 after all mobile phone deals are what we do best! Therefore, we will be starting our Black Friday sale weeks ahead of the big day itself \u2013 make sure to watch out for everything we have in store over the next few weeks!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/black-friday-phone-deals\">Our deals are live<\/a> now so you can shop ahead of the big day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can expect to see some of the best Black Friday deals around \u2013 across the biggest brands! And we are so sure of ourselves and our deals that this year we are offering a price promise.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2><em>Fonehouse\u2019s Black Friday Price Promise<\/em><\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Fonehouse, we are so sure that our deals are the best that we are offering a price promise (<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/images\/misc\/black-friday\/price-promise-terms.pdf\">terms and conditions<\/a> apply).

This also works if you find a better deal elsewhere \u2013 we will match it! So, you can be sure you are getting the best deal at Fonehouse this Black Friday!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What Kind of Black Friday Shopper are You?<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether you love it or hate it, Black Friday deals really are too good to miss. We are sure you have seen the various images from previous years of the stampedes in supermarkets to grab the best TV deals, or people camping outside shops waiting for the Black Friday sale shopping to commence \u2013 however, we\u2019ve come along way since then, and we all shop differently.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Will you be heading to the shops to brave the crowds? Or, sitting in front of the computer ready to bag an online bargain? Let\u2019s take a look at the different types of Black Friday shoppers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Traditional Black Friday Shoppers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The traditional Black Friday shopper is someone who lives for a sale. They have been bargain hunting their entire life, and the thought of sale shopping excites them. They get up early to get there as soon as the shops open and hop from store to store throughout the day. The traditional Black Friday shopper loves the entire experience.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Competitive Black Friday Shoppers<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The competitive Black Friday shoppers can be a little scary if you aren\u2019t one of them. They love the thrill of sale shopping and grabbing the biggest bargains (whether they need them, or not) and they aren\u2019t afraid of pushing people out of the way to do so!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Online Deal Hunter<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The online deal hunter stays home on Black Friday, away from the shops at all costs. They have plenty of tabs open and are hunting on their favourite online stores for the best deals. They will have signed up for all the newsletters and be crawling their emails ready for the big day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Strategic Shopper<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The strategic shopper plans in advance. They know exactly what they are looking for on Black Friday and they are going to get the best deals. They have probably already bagged some bargains in the lead up to the day itself. They have all their accounts set up online to check out as fast as possible and have already hit the shops to avoid the mad rush on the day.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Avoiders<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, we have the Black Friday avoiders \u2013 those who loathe the day entirely and avoid the shops completely. However, we reckon they still hunt for a sneaky online deal \u2013 who can resist!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Which Black Friday Shopper are you?<\/em><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Black Friday Shopping Top Tips<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At Fonehouse, you know we love a deal, so we wanted to share our top tips for shopping this Black Friday!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>1. Be Prepared<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to securing the best deals, being prepared is the only way forward. This means doing your research and deciding exactly what it is you want. Otherwise, you might waste precious shopping time deciding what to purchase. So, have a think about what handset you want to purchase and how much you would like to spend \u2013 deciding this ahead of time also allows you to read some reviews and be confident with your choice.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once you have done this, you can save tabs with the various products you are interested in to save you having to find these to check on the latest deals.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>2. Shop Around<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As part of your research process, it\u2019s important to shop around. This is particularly important as it means you can see what the prices currently are across different sites. Then, when the deals drop you will know which are offering the best deal \u2013 as you are aware of the original price.&nbsp; You can then compare the deals across sites and choose the best one. At Fonehouse, we are offering a price promise across various deals so you know you are getting the best price.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>3. Follow Retailers on Social Media<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Black Friday and sale teasers are big on social media. So, by following your favourite brands you can stay up to date on when the sales are going to start, and which items might be included. It is also beneficial to sign up to newsletters as then you are guaranteed not to miss anything! On this point, you should also set up accounts on the sites you might be shopping on \u2013 just to make the whole process a lot smoother on the day!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>4. Don\u2019t Shop the Latest Releases<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Whilst we all love the latest handsets, and you may still bag a bargain on some of the latest handset releases you can get some incredible discounts on previous models. For example, with the iPhone 13 release in September we can expect to see lots of great deals on iPhone 12 models.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2>5. Start Early<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Long gone are the days when Black Friday was only one day \u2013 it now can span up to a month. Which is fantastic news for deal hunters. People often worry that they have to wait for Black Friday itself to get the best deals but in most cases the deals aren\u2019t any better on the day than they are in the lead up. This year especially, with increased demand and HGV driver concerns, you want to get in there early and be prepared.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all that in mind, we hope you enjoy your Black Friday sale shopping and manage to get some great deals on the handsets you are looking for.
