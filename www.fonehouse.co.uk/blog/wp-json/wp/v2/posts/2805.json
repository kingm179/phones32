We know what it\u2019s like, these things happen, and there\u2019s only so long that you can go on with a smartphone screen that is so smashed that you can barely read your text messages. You need a new handset, and you need one now.<\/p>\n<p>Luckily here at Fonehouse we have some of the best SIM free deals to enable you plenty of choice when it comes to purchasing a new smartphone. In this handy little blog post we\u2019ve pulled together a selection of our finest smartphones for under \u00a3300, but you can check out all of our favourite SIM free deals right here.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Huawei P Smart<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>First on our list of deals is the impressive\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Huawei-P-smart\\\">Huawei P Smart<\/a>. Here at Fonehouse we still feel a little out of sorts calling the P Smart as a \u2018budget\u2019 handset because it really does offer the specs of a smartphone of a much higher calibre. It\u2019s a beautifully designed handset and comes in four stunning colour options, giving the feel of a much more premium phone. But we all know it\u2019s not just about looks; the P Smart is a great little piece of technology.<\/p>\n<p>The Huawei P Smart combines a 5.65 inch, 18:9 screen with a 1080&#215;2160 high resolution display and top of the range specifications. The sharp details and vivid colours of the display are extremely impressive and\u00a0 the ultra responsive fingerprint scanner is an added bonus that is a feature usually reserved for the more expensive handsets on the market.<\/p>\n<p>The P Smart runs on the efficient EMUI 8.0 to give a speedy performance. With 32GB of storage there\u2019s more than enough room for all your favourite photos and apps, and a 3000mAh battery delivers a decent enough performance.<\/p>\n<p>When you add to that a 13MP rear camera with an 8MP front shooter, with both delivering photos of a high quality, this really is a fantastic smartphone for the price.<\/p>\n<p>So how much will the Huawei P Smart set you back? Surprisingly you can get your hands on this great handset for just \u00a3229 at Fonehouse, and with our great next day delivery service you could be texting and snapping pictures the very next day!<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Samsung Galaxy A5<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The upgraded\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Samsung-Galaxy-A5-2017?\\\">Samsung Galaxy A5<\/a>\u00a0is a great option for shoppers who are looking for that reliable Samsung standard of smartphone manufacturing without the price tag that goes along with some of the brands high end smartphones.<\/p>\n<p>Incredibly this smartphone packs a 16MP camera, more high spec than even the S8 or S8+, allowing you to take your photography to the next level and record all of your most important memories in all of their crisp, clear, HD glory.<\/p>\n<p>The A5 is also a really well designed phone, keeping up the high level of intelligent design that we\u2019ve come to know and love from Samsung smartphones. The 5.2 inch Gorilla glass display, and IP68, the A5 make for a durable and reliable handset that can withstand the elements and trials of daily life that won\u2019t let you down. Add to that a huge 3000mAh battery and you know you won\u2019t be caught short on the go with a loss of power.<\/p>\n<p>When you think of Samsung when it comes to SIM free we wouldn\u2019t blame you for assuming that you\u2019re going to have to fork out for an expensive smartphone, however at Fonehouse we want to give you the best brands at the best prices, and that means you can get your hands on the Samsung Galaxy A5 for just \u00a3279, giving you an amazing smartphone at a reasonable price.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Sony Xperia XA2<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>When it comes to affordable smartphones we always like to count on our friends at Sony to deliver.<\/p>\n<p>The\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Sony-Xperia-XA2?\\\">Sony Xperia XA2<\/a>\u00a0is a great value smartphone that combines a 5.2 inch display and is fully equipped with\u00a0 Corning Gorilla Glass, offering both stunning clarity and reinforced durability.<\/p>\n<p>Although the XA2 is affordable, you don\u2019t have to worry about compromising on great specifications. An astonishing 23MP camera is one of the most powerful you\u2019ll see in a handset of this price, featuring Exmor RS for mobile sensor and 4K video recording for incredible quality in any lighting conditions. On top of that there\u2019s also a great 8MP front facing camera for selfies that will always have you looking your best.<\/p>\n<p>At Fonehouse you can get hold of the Xperia XA2 for just \u00a3286, and in our opinion it\u2019s a great option if you\u2019re looking for an affordable handset that won\u2019t let you down.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hunting for a SIM free smartphone that delivers great performance at a reasonable price can often be a frustrating task, but it can also often be an attractive option for those of us who wish to pay a low monthly price on a SIM only contract that will last them a long time.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"categories":[531],"tags":[],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.3 -
