While there is an element of different rules for different countries, generally speaking, the information contained in the following article would apply. If you are concerned about a particular country, then you should check that with your airline before you fly.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">There are lots of reasons why people will want to keep their mobile phone and charger with them in their hand luggage but is this actually allowed? The most basic answer is yes, it is actually considered the safest place to carry your mobile phone charger although you will not be able to charge your device on the plane in most cases. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Putting your phone or charger in the hold means that there is a risk your bag will go missing with your device in it. The airways are such busy places that even in this day and age with the best tracking luggage does still go missing regularly. So it is safer to keep your handset and charger with you, and you should have the phone charged and able to turn on in case you are asked to do so by a member of staff before you board. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">There has been some confusion as to what is allowed due to the fact that some countries decided to ban carrying laptops in hand luggage; however, this does not apply to mobile phones. If you are travelling to some Middle Eastern countries, you may have to put laptops in the hold; however, the charger bizarrely is allowed to stay with you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Again the mobile phone is not recognised under these legislation\\&#8217;s and can stay with you and your hand luggage. It will depend on whether the airlines have trouble from passengers carrying such devices as to whether the rules change again in the near future so the bottom line is you should always check before you travel if you are concerned.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">If you have a power bank charger which is basically a form of second battery, there are rules that apply here as well. These tend to be stricter because the power banks are lithium-ion batteries. A lot of airlines actually prohibit the carrying of power banks in checked luggage that means you must carry them in your hand luggage, but there are some restrictions you should know about. To be able to take a power bank on a plane, it must not exceed 100W if it does it is not allowed on the flight. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Anything that is smaller than that is fine, but you may be asked by security to turn on the device to demonstrate what it is you are carrying. So this means your power bank should be charged before you travel as if you cannot successfully turn it on when you requested it can\u2019t be confiscated.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whether you are headed off to grab some summer sun or whether you frequently travel with work, it is essential to understand the rules and regulations regarding electronic items, including your mobile phone.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":3679,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"categories":[26],"tags":[163,247],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.3 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>Can I Take my Mobile Phone Charger in Hand Luggage?
