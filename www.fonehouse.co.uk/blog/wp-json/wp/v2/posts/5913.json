Including the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g\\\">Samsung Galaxy S21<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-5g\\\">S21 Plus<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-5g\\\">S21 Ultra<\/a>. And it is not stopping there \u2013 we are still expecting to see some more big releases from the likes of Samsung, Sony, Xiaomi, Nokia, and OnePlus just to name a few.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, we can\u2019t discuss the most anticipated phone releases of the year without mentioning Apple\u2019s eagerly awaited announcement on the next iPhone \u2013 but aside from that we have some other rumoured releases that we think are quite exciting as well.<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<h2>The New iPhone<\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Each year, the Apple iPhone release tends to be the most highly anticipated \u2013 and this year is no different. As always, we\u2019re all expecting this release in September and the rumour mill is already churning as to what we might expect from Apple this time around.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst nothing is confirmed, it has been reported by sites such as <a href=\"https:\/\/www.techradar.com\/uk\/news\/new-iphone-13-2021\\\">TechRadar<\/a>, that the new iPhone won\u2019t differ too much in design from its predecessor \u2013 the iPhone 12. However, we\u2019re sure there will be plenty of new, exciting upgrades to the current specification and we\u2019re looking forward to finding out more. Like the ones before it, rumours say that there will be plenty of options when it comes to the variants of the handsets \u2013 such as the \u201cmini\u201d and \u201cPro\u201d versions.<\/p>\n<ol start=\\\"2\\\">\n<li>\n<h2>The New Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Range<\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>At Fonehouse, we can appreciate something a little bit weird but wonderful. And, that is exactly what we\u2019re expecting from the New Samsung Galaxy Fold Handset. Following on from the release of the Z Fold 2 in 2020, this new release from Samsung is going to continue building on the relatively new success of the foldable phone.<\/p>\n<p>Still in their early days, foldable phones have a way to go \u2013 so over the next few years we would expect improvements in things such as durability, size, and weight to ensure these phones get lighter and thinner as they develop.<\/p>\n<ol start=\\\"3\\\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>Huawei P50 <\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Always the innovators, Huawei\u2019s latest release is expected to top their last in terms of design and specification. Things that are rumoured to be improved in Huawei P50 are the camera and hardware. We\u2019re expecting big things from the camera in this phone \u2013 with Huawei consistently topping the market when it comes to camera quality.<\/p>\n<p>The only downfall might be the software \u2013 Huawei currently do not have access to Google apps or the Google Play Store, which can hamper the experience in terms of software. However, more than likely Huawei developed Apps will run through \u201cHuawei Petal Search\u201d from Launch. \u00a0We are hopeful that this will change in time, however, so we are excited to see this next release from Huawei \u2013 and, it will be sooner than you think with the Chinese launch set for the end of July.<\/p>\n<ol start=\\\"4\\\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>The New Samsung Galaxy Fan Edition Range<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>The first of the FE series was launched by Samsung in 2020 and means \u2018fan edition\u2019. This range of the Samsung Galaxy is therefore supposed to encompass everything that the Galaxy S fans want and love about their phones \u2013 but at a reasonable price and Samsung has not included all the more \u2018premium\u2019 features of the mainstream Galaxy S series.<\/p>\n<p>Back for 2021 with the second in the series, the new version of the FE is expected to launch in August alongside other new products. It is expected to take some influence in terms of design from the Galaxy S21, but with some slight difference in appearance. It will be pretty similar in terms of specification but do expect it to cost a little less than the S21, as with its predecessor.<\/p>\n<ol start=\\\"5\\\">\n<li>\n<h2><strong>OnePlus 9T<\/strong><\/h2>\n<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<p>Following the release of the OnePlus 9, we are expecting a further release from the company this year \u2013 the OnePlus 9T. Rather than a completely new phone \u2013 we are expecting the 9T to be an upgraded version of its predecessor.<\/p>\n<p>There isn\u2019t much known about this phone yet \u2013 but we are hoping to see this release later in the year towards the autumn\/winter.<\/p>\n<p>We hope you are as excited about these new releases as we are, whilst we only know rumours at this stage \u2013 there are definitely rumours to get excited about.
