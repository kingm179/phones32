And we\u2019ve got great news. As this is a lower tier handset, we didn\u2019t expect to see an IP rating so it\u2019s interesting that Apple have invested in this. Everyone is also shocked at just how just this small handset can resistant.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Get to know the IP rating<\/h2>\n<p>When a phone is released, a company may choose to invest in having the phone tested and certified with an IP rating. This shows the resistance levels against small particles and liquids. When you take a look at the iPhone SE, you\u2019ll find out it actually has an IP67 rating, which is one of the higher levels of protection available these days. But, what does this all really mean?<\/p>\n<p>The I represents protection against small particles, such as dust. The level of protection against these particles is then represented by the first number, in this case that would be 6. This means that the phone is completely resistant against damage from small particles. You\u2019ll see that this is pretty standard amongst all major handsets now. The P shows that the phone has some sort of protection against liquid. The level of protection is represented by the last number, with the iPhone SE being 7. Following certifications, this shows that the phone is protected against the effects of water between 15cm and 1 metre for up to 30 minutes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>The Limitations<\/h2>\n<p>Of course, with anything, there\u2019s limitations that you\u2019ll want to be aware of. So, from the above, you can see that the answer to, \u2018is the iPhone SE waterproof\u2019 is pretty obvious. Whilst your phone is not going to completely combust if you don\u2019t stick to the limitations, it\u2019s likely to get some level of water damage, which is not covered by warranty.<\/p>\n<p>You will only be able to use the iPhone SE in up to 1 metre of liquid for up to 30 minutes. As long as you\u2019re not swimming along the bottom of a pool or swimming in the sea with the smartphone, you should be absolutely fine. If you spill a drink over your phone, leave it in the bathroom whilst showering or even just want to snap a few pictures next to the pool, you\u2019ll be absolutely fine to do so. You won\u2019t be able to keep the iPhone SE in water for longer if it\u2019s not at the 1 metre limit as water will begin to leak into the phone after this point. You also won\u2019t be able to take the phone deeper than this limit for any length of time.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Is the iPhone SE waterproof?<\/h2>\n<p>In short, the iPhone SE is not waterproof but it is water resistant. An important thing to take into consideration when trying to find out whether or not a phone is waterproof is that waterproof and water resistant are not the same. Currently, you won\u2019t find a smartphone that is completely waterproof as we just don\u2019t have that technology. As more and more phones are released, we\u2019re seeing the damage caused by liquids drop significantly. Overall, you\u2019ll be safe taking the iPhone SE in small amounts of water within the suggested time frame.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully, this can all answer your question of \u2018is the iPhone SE waterproof?
