As a budget smartphone, this addition really opens the market up to a lot more people. Enjoy the very best of Huawei technology for only a fraction of the cost.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Unique Design<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever seen a Huawei device, you\u2019ll know that they are very high end feeling smartphones. They will all offer a similar, yet unique design. The more high end devices will have glass backs whilst lower tier handsets have plastic finishes for a very clean finish. With the Huawei P Smart 2020, you get a plastic frame and back. Sat in the middle of the phone is a fingerprint sensor to allow for quick, secure access. In the top corner is the camera set up. This leaves plenty of room for you to enjoy the overall gloss finish.<\/p>\n<p>There are three different colour options available with the Huawei P Smart 2020. With Midnight Black, Aurora Blue and Green variants available, you\u2019re able to choose your own style. For something a little more laid back, you might opt for the understated Midnight black choice. If you want something colourful and spritely, the Aurora Blue and Green options are your perfect match. Pulling this very clean, smooth design over to the front of the phone are the rounded edges and corners.<\/p>\n<p>On the front of the phone, you\u2019re met with a 6.21 inch LTPS IPS LCD display. This gives you plenty of room to view exactly what you want from your phone. With such a larger viewing space, you\u2019ll be completely immersed within any films or videos you watch as well as find yourself scrolling less when browsing. With a 1080 x 2340 pixel resolution, you can ensure that everything will be in a super high quality picture too.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Get to know the camera<\/h2>\n<p>Huawei always seems to create very impressive camera systems, even in lower tier smartphones, such as the Huawei P Smart 2020. They\u2019re known for the outstanding, crystal clear photographs you see plastered all over social media. Featured on the back of this device is a dual lens camera, consisting of a 13MP standard lens and a 2MP depth lens. These two options will give you very different finishes across your photos. You will have to manually change between lenses to avoid different styles when you don\u2019t want them.<\/p>\n<p>Most of your photos will be taken with the standard lens, creating high quality, detailed photographs. You\u2019ll be shooting in a standard frame with no special angles or focal lengths present. You will also find that his lens helps to produce relatively high quality photos during low light situations too. With the depth lens, you\u2019ll be able to make your photos pop out more but simply adding depth. This lens will look to accentuate highlights, shadows and colours in your subject whilst carefully softening the background. This will leave you with a very clean, professional finish on any portrait photos.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, this is a lower tier handset so you aren\u2019t going to get as many camera features as you will on newer Huawei devices. As well as this, you\u2019ll probably find that any features it does have aren\u2019t as high spec are other handsets. That being said, you\u2019ll still be able to experience high quality photos with a fun range of features available.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Huawei P Smart 2020 Deals<\/h2>\n<p>We have a huge range of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/huawei-p-smart-2020\\\">amazing Huawei P Smart 2020 deals<\/a> across three of the best networks in the UK, Three, Vodafone and EE.
