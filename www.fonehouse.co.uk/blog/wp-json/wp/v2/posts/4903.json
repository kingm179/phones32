Lucky for you, we\u2019ve got a whole list of apps that you\u2019ll be able to download and use for a long time with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/best-mobile-phone-deals\\\">mobile phone.<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Mobile Must Haves<\/h2>\n<p>Before you go looking for some of the hidden treasures in the app store, you want to make sure you\u2019ve got all the essentials first. These are the types of apps that you\u2019ll constantly go back to, over and over again. You can never get bored of these!<\/p>\n<p>TikTok has very quickly grown to be one of the biggest platforms in a short amount of time. You\u2019ll find yourself spending hours scrolling through feeds, maybe you\u2019ll even dabble in making a few! Essentially, TIkTok allows creators to share short videos, up to 60 seconds, with different effects and sounds. You can create a new sound or you can use someone else\u2019s. This platform really allows for everyone to get creative.<\/p>\n<p>If you haven\u2019t got YouTube on your smartphone, where have you been hiding. This app is such a standard app to have on any smartphone now. For anyone who doesn\u2019t know, YouTube is a content platform, full of videos made by different creators. They can range from makeup videos and lifestyle vlogs to gaming channels and even news channels. This is one of the best mobile apps if you\u2019re looking to find a whole range of different content.<\/p>\n<p>Another app that is completely essential is Netflix. EVERYONE knows what Netflix is and most people are on the platform. Through this, you\u2019ll be able to watch a whole range of different films, series or documentaries. \u00a0Whether you\u2019re looking for classics or something new, you\u2019ll be able to find something to suit you.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Apps to keep you connected<\/h2>\n<p>Something everyone is struggling with whilst in lockdown is not seeing their friends and family. This has meant that video calling has got a whole lot more popular. People are choosing to connect with their loved ones in ways they perhaps didn\u2019t before. A great thing about having all the modern technology we have is that apps can make this a whole lot more fun.<\/p>\n<p>Zoom has blown up since the UK first went into lockdown and people are loving it. This is an application which allows you to video call multiple different people at the same time in a group. You can choose to pay for a membership to allow more people and longer meetings if that\u2019s what you want. The best thing about this membership is that it\u2019s super cheap for what it is. To make the call a little more fun, you can add different backgrounds and share screens. This makes it perfect for pub quiz nights at home!<\/p>\n<p>This is one of the best mobile apps if you\u2019re looking to video call your friends whilst playing some games. You can add up to 8 people in one room and can lock it if need be. There\u2019s a whole host of different games that allow you to have a bit more of an entertaining night than you had perhaps expected. There isn\u2019t an option to upgrade to a subscription allowing more people in.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Best Mobile Apps for Entertainment<\/h2>\n<p>What you\u2019re really here for is to find out what apps are going to keep you entertained. There are too many different apps to compile every single one into one place. These are a few of our favourite apps that are guaranteed to keep you busy for hours on end!<\/p>\n<p>The start of 2020 brought the introduction of Disney+ and we promise, you\u2019re going to love it. Whether you\u2019re a Disney fanatic or not, there\u2019s hundreds of different films and series to watch. You\u2019ll be able to dive in with the classics or test the water with some newer films. You\u2019re going to be reliving your childhood during quarantine with tis app! You do have to pay for a subscription, but it\u2019s super cheap. You can also cancel this subscription at any time!<\/p>\n<p>Ever find yourself really wanting to play a good old board game but you just don\u2019t have it anymore? You can now play these games from the comfort of your own phone with classic board games apps. This app gives you the ability to play online with your friends on many of your favourite board games.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Apps to play with your friends<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s so hard to pinpoint the best mobile apps to play with your friends as there are just too many to look at. When playing mobile apps with your friends, you\u2019re probably going to want to make sure that they\u2019re as cheap as you can find.<\/p>\n<p>A great option for anyone looking to play games with friends whilst in lockdown is Evil Apples. This is an app that works just the same as Cards Against Humanity. One person will put down a card with a blank space and everyone else needs to fill in the blank with their funniest card. Whoever reaches the set goal first is the winner. You can create multiple different games and play with a large group of friends to make this seriously funny.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst it\u2019s not a mobile app, there\u2019s a website called Jackbox Games, which is full of different party games you can play with your friends. One person takes control of the game and can add up to 10 000 people at one time. These can be guessing games or even quizzes.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>There are so many different ways you can stay entertained during lockdown, especially with the best mobile apps you can get! You\u2019re going to want to make sure you\u2019ve got a phone that can hack it!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>With the situation we\u2019re all finding ourselves in at the moment, you\u2019re probably looking for the best mobile apps to keep you busy in lockdown.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4900,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"categories":[529],"tags":[49,200],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.3 -
