We can tell you everything about this offer from what\u2019s included to the features you\u2019ll get out of it. Offering an extra bit of value is just one of the reasons as to why Sony is growing quicker than ever before.<\/p>\n<h2>What is the Sony Xperia 5 II pre order offer?<\/h2>\n<p>When you opt for a Sony Xperia 5 II pre order deal, you\u2019ll receive a pair of Sony WH-XB900N headphones too. This allows us to add so much more value into your mobile phone contract. By pre ordering the Sony Xperia 5 II, you\u2019ll get some of the best pay monthly contract deals on the market. With pre order kicking off in the next few days, you\u2019re going to want to keep your eye out. By snatching up this amazing promotional offer, you\u2019ll save a huge \u00a3230. Don\u2019t settle for less when you can get more from your phone contract.<\/p>\n<h2>Sony WH-XB900N Headphone Design<\/h2>\n<p>Sony has always been very good at giving their devices an all over slick design. With that in mind, it\u2019s not surprising that these Sony headphones have a very professional finish to them. The entire finish of the headphones is a soft, matte design. On the band, there\u2019s a raised, glossy Sony logo and a few buttons on the earpads. With one smooth colour across the entire device, you get a high class style all over. It also makes sure that it doesn\u2019t take away from your outfit or make you look unprofessional.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, you\u2019re going to want to be able to use these headphones for hours on end. With such a high quality design and audio, it\u2019s understandable as to why. With that in mind, Sony has built the WH-XB900N with cushioned ear pads. This means that you won\u2019t have the classic pressure on your ears. They allow for a much longer use than ever before.<\/p>\n<p>In ear headphones can be extremely uncomfortable to wear for extended periods of time. That\u2019s where over ear headphones have a much more suitable use. One issue is that they\u2019re so big you have to wear them or carry them. It\u2019s not as simple as popping them in your bag, until now. The headphones included in the Sony Xperia 5 II pre order offer are foldable so that when you\u2019re done using them, you can pop them back in your bag. They\u2019re perfect for travelling, work or just wearing around the house.<\/p>\n<h2>Sony WH-XB900N Headphone Features<\/h2>\n<p>Battery power is probably one of the most important parts of these headphones, outside of the audio of course. On just one charge, you\u2019ll be able to listen to 30 hours of audio. This means they\u2019ll last you the entire day without even worrying about losing power. If you want to quickly use your headphones but forgot to charge them, 10 minutes on charge can provide up to 60 minutes. You can charge them whilst on your coffee break and they\u2019ll be good to go for quite some time.<\/p>\n<p>We have all experienced the situation where you\u2019re wearing headphones and someone starts to talk to you. You have to take your headphones off and put them on once done talking. With the Sony WH-XB900N, you can avoid this with Quick Attention. When someone wants to talk to you, all you need to do is put your hand over your hand over your right ear and the volume will be turned down. Noise cancellation will be turned off so that you\u2019re able to hear everything that\u2019s going on around you. When you want to listen again, just take your hand away.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst the headphones that are included in the promo come with some of the best standard settings available, you may want to play around with them a little. If you do want to change settings, you can do this through the Sony Headphones Connect app. This is downloadable from the Google Play Store and is super easy to set up. Adjust the equaliser, sound levels and sound control amongst so many other options to find the audio that\u2019s perfect for you. You can even change the settings for different tasks, such as playing games, watching films<\/p>\n<h2>Sony WH-XB900N Headphone Audio<\/h2>\n<p>One of the largest features making the Sony WH-XB900N headphone audio outstanding is Extra Bass. You really are going to be able to tell the difference between any other headphones and these. Any lower frequencies will be enhanced to create an audio unlike any other. There are a number of different features that play to make sure that you\u2019re getting the clearest audio available but this feature allows for a very high quality bass.<\/p>\n<p>A huge perk of the WH-XB900N headphones is the 360 reality audio feature that is built into it. With this audio feature, you\u2019re going to have a surround sound unlike any other. Dive into the audio on your phone and completely immerse yourself. This technology will transport you and make you feel as if you\u2019re really there, where the audio is being recorded. With realistic audio all of the time, you\u2019ll never want to take these headphones off or put the new Xperia down. You won\u2019t find headphones as immersive as these.<\/p>\n<p>Noise cancelling technology is seen a lot in Sony headphones however, the WH-XB900N has some of the best noise cancelling we\u2019ve ever seen. With this feature, you can block out the rest of the world and get lost in your audio. You won\u2019t have to worry about traffic noises whilst you\u2019re walking down the street or the buzz in the shopping centre. By cutting out all exterior noises, you can ensure that every single part of your audio is heard in the best way possible.
