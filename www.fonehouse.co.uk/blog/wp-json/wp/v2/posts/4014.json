One of the most appealing characteristics of Apple phones is that they have a very user-friendly design. You can customise almost any element of the phone, and it\u2019s possible to do so without knowing masses about how it works.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">So if you want to change the layout for your phone, and rearrange the applications that you have for it, you can do this. We\u2019re going to be taking a look at what you need to do to be able to move your apps around.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Moving Apps Around<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">So let\u2019s talk about how you go about moving applications around on your iPhone 8 Plus. Thankfully, it\u2019s not that difficult to do. Of course, what\u2019s comfortable for one person is not easy for another, so let\u2019s start from the top.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">To start with, just press and hold on any app you want. It doesn\u2019t matter which. If you\u2019ve done it correctly, then all of the applications will start to move and jiggle. Now you can quickly move them around to suit your needs and requirements.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">To change the position of an app, just pick it up and move it with your finger. It\u2019s worth mentioning that when you do this, you\u2019ll be putting the application into the same space that a different one occupied. To accomplish this, the whole page is moved along one square. Every app will move along to the right, and some will go onto the next page as a result. Don\u2019t worry, though; you can just drag and drop to suit your needs.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Making Folders<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">If you pick up an application and allow it to sit on top of another one, then you\\&#8217;ll create a folder. This feature is a part of the organisation layout, which will enable you to collect applications which have a similar function and then put them all in one place. Apple will suggest titles for these folders too, so it becomes easy to order things. Plus, if you collect everything into folders, you can see your home screen wallpaper a little better, so the options are pretty limitless.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">So, there are a lot of options for you to consider when it comes to customising your phone. Apple\\&#8217;s made it easy for people to experiment and change things according to their whims. As you can imagine, this makes them quite accessible. With multiple ways to stylise your lock screen and a selection of different options available, there\\&#8217;s all the variety you could need. Plus, the opportunity to create a folder is there if you need it. Being able to put all the apps that serve a similar function in one place is very helpful. Surprisingly, more people don\\&#8217;t categorise like this, but hey &#8211; it\\&#8217;s the choice you\\&#8217;ve always got available.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The iPhone 8 Plus is one of the most recent models from Apple, and while it has been out on the market for a few years, it\u2019s still a compelling and capable alternative to some of the flagship models the company has.
