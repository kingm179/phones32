Easy! We\u2019ve put together a simple guide to help you stay on top of your redemption cashback claims. You\u2019ll want to make sure you take it all in as much as possible to get the largest savings available.<\/p>\n<h2>Claiming Cashback<\/h2>\n<p>It\u2019s super simple to claim your cashback. There aren\u2019t too many steps, you just need to understand when to claim. All that\u2019s required to submit a cashback claim is your network bill and your Fonehouse account. The first email you receive from us will be a validation link to this account. Click this as soon as you receive it and set a password for your new Fonehouse account. When you want to claim cashback, just login into your account and click the button titled \u2018Claim Cashback\u2019 in the bottom left corner.<\/p>\n<p>You\u2019ll see a cashback form appear on screen. This asks for your order number, name. email address, date of birth, network, telephone number and bill date. You\u2019ll also need to include a PDF download of your relevant bill, make sure you keep reading to find out which dates these are. All you need to do is enter the details given when you placed the order and submit your claim. You\u2019ll get an email shortly confirming your claim has been submitted successfully and our finance team will get to processing it within 14 working days.<\/p>\n<p>If you have any issues when trying to claim, you will need to contact customer services who will be able to help rectify the problems. Send an email to <a href=\"mailto:support@fonehouse.co.uk\">support@fonehouse.co.uk<\/a> with your PDF bill attached and all the details needed on the claim form. It\u2019s important you do this last step in case it\u2019s a simple fix with changing some details that you\u2019re entering.<\/p>\n<h2>12 Month Redemption Cashback Claim Dates<\/h2>\n<p>Depending on which contract you have taken out, your claim dates may differ slightly. One thing that doesn\u2019t change at all is how the cashback is claimed. Please read the above section for information into how to claim. You will only have a SIM only 12 month contract, we don\u2019t currently offer this length for handset plans. The shorter the contract, the higher the price is. We like to ensure that our deals are as affordable as possible to keep our customers happy.<\/p>\n<p>Redemption cashback has to be claimed for in 5 equal instalments. For anyone on a 12 month contract, you will need to submit your PDF network bill in billing months 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12. You must submit a claim within 60 days of receiving the bill or you risk missing out on the claim. We do suggest putting a reminder in your phone so that you\u2019re able to keep up with these savings. If you claim outside of this 60 day period then you risk not having payment of cashback.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have successfully submitted your claim, you will receive an email letting you know it will be processed. The Fonehouse finance team will process the submitted claim within 14 working days and pay the instalment within 21 working days if accepted.<\/p>\n<h2>18 &amp; 24 Month Redemption Cashback Claim Dates<\/h2>\n<p>Claiming for cashback on an 18 or 24 month plan is almost exactly the same as claiming on a 12 month plan. The only difference is when you claim for the payments. Just like 12 month plans, you won\u2019t find an 18 month handset plan. This is for the same reason, to ensure our deals stay affordable. There are both 18 and 24 month SIM only plans. If you have either of these contracts, then this is when you need to claim your cashback.<\/p>\n<p>All redemption cashback is paid in 5 equal instalments. You don\u2019t get paid any more for the first claim, we make sure every single claim is the same amount throughout. By the end of the 5 claims, you should have the full balance, as long as all submissions were successful. For anyone on an 18 or 24 month plan, you will need to claim for your cashback in billing months 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18. Make sure that you successfully submit your claim within the 60 day period or the cashback will not be paid. Again, we do suggest you set a reminder in your phone so you never miss the savings.<\/p>\n<p>You will receive an email, letting you know that your submission has been received. Within 14 days, the Fonehouse finance team will process the claim. If accepted, they will pay the instalment via BACS to the bank account given on your order within 21 days. It\u2019s important to let us know of any detail changes so we can avoid delays.<\/p>\n<h2>Reasons for rejection<\/h2>\n<p>Any claim will be rejected if it\\&#8217;s submitted outside of the 60 day period. There is no chance for this to be contested. We suggest that customers submit their bills as soon as they receive them from the network in order to avoid this issue. It also gives you a lot more time to solve any other potential issues that arise.<\/p>\n<p>We only pay cashback to customers who are up to date with their network bills. If you are behind on bills, we cannot pay you until it is resolved. Customers who have been disconnected from their network will have orders and cashback cancelled. You will need to have a new, completed order with cashback if you want to continue.<\/p>\n<p>We set our cashback specific to the deals we have on our website. When these deals are changed by the customer or the network, the cashback is affected. We highly suggest not changing your tariff if you want to receive the cashback extra as we will be forced to withdraw any cashback offers if this happens. If you are unsure of any changes to your contract, please contact Fonehouse directly.<\/p>\n<p>When you\u2019re submitting your cashback form, you\u2019ll be asked for a few details. If these do not match what we hold on your order, the cashback claim will be rejected. It\u2019s super easy to avoid this issue as you can update your details with Fonehouse directly. If you need to change anything, simply get in contact with us and we can help.<\/p>\n<p>Cashback can also be rejected if the wrong bill is submitted. As long as you follow the above cashback claim dates, the bill will be correct. Just double check that the bill date you enter on the form matches the date shown on the network bill.<\/p>\n<h2>Automatic Cashback<\/h2>\n<p>You may notice that we have two different forms of cashback on our website. These are redemption and automatic cashback. You\u2019ll find a huge range of both these extras however, automatic cashback is a little different. It doesn\u2019t allow for as high savings as redemption cashback does however, it requires no claiming whatsoever. It\u2019s one lump sum that we will pay directly to the bank account on your order. After 90 days, our finance team will check that you\u2019re up to date with network bills and process the payment. It\u2019s important to let us know of any changes to your details before this period to avoid delays.<\/p>\n<p>Cashback really is as simple a couple clicks and a reminder. If there are problems with your cashback, you\u2019ll receive an email to let you know within 14 days. If you have any other questions, our customer service team is on hand to answer them.
