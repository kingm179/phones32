As the highest specification device from Apple in 2020, it\u2019s easy to understand why this phone is so popular. From its price to its design, there\u2019s so many improvements from the 2018 range.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What keeps it going?<\/h2>\n<p>Keeping the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max powered is actually a 3969mAh battery pack. Whilst you may be thinking that this isn\u2019t as large as a lot of other batteries on the market, it can do far better than most of them. On average, you\u2019ll be able to get around 80 hours of power on a single charge. This means you can go about your day without even having to think about a dead battery. For those times when you do run a little low, the phone supports wireless charging and fast charging 18W for a super quick power up.<\/p>\n<p>Having a variety of memory options to choose from is becoming more and more important. We keep millions of photos, videos, apps, emails and so much more on our smartphones. That\u2019s why you\u2019re able to purchase this device in either 64GB, 256GB or 512GB. Every single one of these options is huge and will allow you to enjoy the majority of your 24 month contract with no worry. If you do ever find that you\u2019re running a little low on memory, you\u2019ll need to use some form of cloud storage, such as iCloud as there\u2019s no memory card slot.<\/p>\n<p>Chipsets act as the brains of a smartphone. With this in mind, Apple designed the A13 Bionic, the fastest chipset in a smartphone. With this component running it, the 11 Pro Max is going to offer it\u2019s users an experience unlike ever before. Stream without buffering. Download without interruptions. Even download in a matter of seconds. Not only does the A13 give you fast speeds though. This chip also ensures that the battery puts power to the places you use often, rather than wasting it on pointless areas. It even works with the camera system to give you the best photos.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Design Features<\/h2>\n<p>Sticking with a very classic feature of Apple smartphones, the iPhone 11 Pro Max has a high end, all glass design. By having this glass backing, you\u2019re able to enjoy a very expensive feeling design. It gives a glossy finish that really catches the light. With such an eye catching design, you\u2019ll want to be sure that you enjoy it to your full potential. That\u2019s why there\u2019s very little on the back of the phone. With only the Apple logo and the camera setup, you\u2019ve got the rest of the phone to show off.<\/p>\n<p>To match this flashy design, you\u2019ve got some flashy colours too. Choose from the typical Apple colours with Space Grey and Silver. These are both incredibly understated colours that give you an overall expensive feel. They\u2019re perfect for anyone who just wants to throw a case on the phone or even keep it professional. Whilst staying high end and office acceptable, the Gold and Midnight Green options add a little more excitement. These are both newer colours that give you a fun yet high end design all over. No matter which colour you choose, you\u2019ll get to enjoy the same glossy finish.<\/p>\n<p>Even if the back of a phone is spotless, the display still needs to be up to standards, after all, it is a touch screen smartphone. On the iPhone 11 Pro Max, you can enjoy a 6.5 inch super Retina XDR OLED display and it\u2019s an impressive one. Apple has used the Retina OLED displays for some time now as it gives them super vibrant colours whilst staying a little different to competitors. This large screen gives you a huge viewing area with only a small notch at the top, which holds the speaker and camera.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Best iPhone 11 Pro Max Deals<\/h2>\n<p>Here at Fonehouse, we like to make sure we\u2019ve got the very best iPhone 11 Pro Max deals by giving you affordable prices for value packed contracts.
