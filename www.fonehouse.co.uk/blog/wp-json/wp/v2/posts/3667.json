However, one place it should not be used is when you are behind the wheel of a car.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Naturally, it is vital that you maintain control of your car, and a failure to do so because of a mobile phone can result in you getting penalty points, which affect your license and your ability to drive if you accumulate too many. We will be taking a look at how many points you get for using your mobile phone while driving.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>How Many Points Can I Lose?<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The police can stop you whenever they feel you are not obeying the law. Before you can understand how many points you can lose and why you must first follow the rules when it comes to phones and driving. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">When you are behind the wheel of a car, it is illegal to hold your phone. You must have access to it in the form of a hands-free variant. This includes such things as a Bluetooth headset or a mount on your windscreen. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">However, anything which you use to secure your phone for hands-free use cannot block your view of the road or any traffic. The police are well within their rights to stop you if they feel you are not in full control of your vehicle because you don\u2019t have the proper view of the road and your surrounding environment.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Penalty Points &#8211; Your Punishment<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Okay, let\u2019s get down to the heart of the matter. If you are caught using a phone while driving, you can get a maximum of six penalty points. You can also get a \u00a3200 fine. If it has been two years or less since you passed your driving test, getting six penalty points will also automatically have your licence taken away from you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">On the other end of the scale, you will find that if you don\u2019t have a full view of the road and you\u2019re pulled over, you will get three penalty points. This rule also applies if you have a set up for your phone which grants you less than full control over the vehicle. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Anything which compromises your safety or the safety of people around you will leave you subject to penalty points, so make sure that you have taken the necessary precautions. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your mobile phone is a potent tool which can be used in many areas of your life.
