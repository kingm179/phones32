From a few setting changes to whole features you never even knew about, we\u2019ve got the ins and outs. Learning these tricks will make sure you stay up to date and even give you the chance to teach your friends and family. Make sure you make the best use of your iPhone Xr!<\/p>\n<h2>Disguise Any App<\/h2>\n<p>Sometimes, we have the need to hide different apps. Whether you\u2019re trying to hide your dating apps from friends or keep your favourite games away from the kids, there\u2019s always a reason. With your iPhone Xr, you\u2019ll get a preinstalled app called \u2018Shortcuts\u2019, this is how we\u2019re going to hide any apps. First of all, you\u2019re going to need to open the Shortcut app and tap \u2018Create Shortcut\u2019. Tap \u2018Add Action\u2019 and add the action called \u2018Open App\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Once you have done this, select the app you want to hide. Tap \u2018Add to Home Screen\u2019 and add the name and icon you want it to appear as. It\u2019s a great idea to name this after an app people won\u2019t want to open and use it\u2019s icon, such as compass. There you go! Now, you\u2019ve got a hidden app, right in plain sight.<\/p>\n<h2>Secret Messages<\/h2>\n<p>A truly sneaky trick you can do on your iPhone Xr is send messages to other iPhone users secretly. To do this, make sure you\u2019ve got the latest version of the Apple Notes app downloaded. Create a new note to get started and name it whatever you want. In the top corner, you\u2019ll see a small icon, allowing you to add iOS users, tap this. Type in the name of whoever you want to secretly chat with and add them to your notes. Now, you can type different messages in real time with the other person. Simply delete them when you\u2019re done.<\/p>\n<h2>Create Fun Insta Stories<\/h2>\n<p>A few years ago, Apple allowed the feature which records your screen when you request it to. Using this option, you can actually create some incredible Instagram stories. Start by uploading the picture you want on your story but don\u2019t post it live. Tap on the pen and choose a colour that compliments your photo. Hold your finger on the screen to cover the entire photo.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you need to start a screen recording by pulling down from the top corner to reveal the control centre. Tap the screen recording icon and head back to the Instagram story. Using the eraser tool, slowly remove the colour that\u2019s over the top of the subject of your photo. Cancel the screen recording and head to your gallery to crop the video to remove anything you don\u2019t need. Now, just head back to Instagram and upload the video for a fun and never before seen story.<\/p>\n<h2>Secret Phone Codes<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019ve ever tried to call someone without your caller ID showing, you\u2019ll know how difficult it is to actually find out how to do this! Apple actually has a few different codes you can use to achieve this. The codes you can use are \u2018*67\u2019 or \u2018#31#\u2019 before entering your own number. Once you press the green call button, there will be no caller ID appearing on the screen on the other users. This is a super way to prank other people but be careful, some call receivers may get annoyed or even not answer.<\/p>\n<h2>Spam With Emojis<\/h2>\n<p>Emojis are Apple\u2019s favourite way of expressing yourself. These are tiny little pictures that you can use instead of words. At the moment, there\u2019s pretty much an emoji for any situation. You can find a range of faces, places, flags and so much more. To truly show your emotions off in full, you can actually cover someone\u2019s screen in emojis. To do this, select your first emoji, press return 4 times, select another emoji, press return another 4 times and choose one more emoji. Now, hold down the blue send button, slide across to screen and send the message as an echo. This will rain emojis on your screen.<\/p>\n<h2>Apple iPhone Xr Tips<\/h2>\n<p>The next addition to our Apple iPhone Xr tips and tricks requires you to have Snapchat. This is a messaging app that comes to delete messages once they\u2019ve been sent. We all know the feeling of walking down the street and seeing a dog that we just fall in love with but don\u2019t know what breed it is. We;;, now we\u2019ve got a way around that.<\/p>\n<p>Start by opening up the Snapchat app and make sure you\u2019re on the back camera. Point the camera at the dog you\u2019ve seen and long press on the display. Previously, this allowed you to find out the names and artists of different songs. Snapchat have created a button to do this instead. Now, holding down on the screen whilst pointing the camera at a dog will tell you what breed that dog is. Finding your perfect best friend has never been so easy!<\/p>\n<p>Now that you\u2019re able to master these Apple iPhone Xr tips and tricks, you\u2019ll be dying to teach everyone else!
