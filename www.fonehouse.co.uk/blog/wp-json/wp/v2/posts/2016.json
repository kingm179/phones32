Not necessarily because they don\u2019t make good smartphones, but rather because they\u2019ve been overshadowed by much bigger brands. Don\u2019t get us wrong, we\u2019ve always been aware of Sony, but they\u2019ve always been more like background noise in a sea of iPhones and Galaxy handsets.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Recent released have ensured that this opinion has begun to change, and slowly but surely Sony have started to make an impact once again, not least because of their most recent release with the XZ2 series. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The XZ2 and XZ2 Compact have both received generally extremely positive reviews, but we wanted to try them out ourselves to be sure.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Look.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">We half expected the XZ2 to retain the more traditional sharp edged design that Sony have subconsciously made their trademark with recent releases, however the curved edges and softer design that comes with both the XZ2 and XZ2 Compact is a welcome change. However unlike many smartphones released this year, the Sony Xperia XZ2 handsets aren\u2019t completely bezel free. This may not bother you in the slightest &#8211; it is a minute detail in our opinion which doesn\u2019t negatively affect the design of the phone &#8211; but if you\u2019re looking for that ultra minimal, clean design that you can find with a number of high end smartphones, you may want to look elsewhere.<\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter wp-image-739 size-full\\\" src=\\\"http:\/\/blog.ktmonline.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/sony-xperia-XZ2.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"400\\\" \/>(<em>the Xperia XZ2)<\/em><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Both the XZ2 and the Compact version come in four high finish colours so there really is a handset for everyone; whatever your style, there\u2019ll undoubtedly be a handset to suit your persona. The addition of Gorilla Glass 5 across the front and back means that even the most clumsy of owners will be able to look after the XZ2 series. <\/span><\/p>\n<p style=\\\"text-align: center;\\\"><img class=\\\"aligncenter wp-image-738 size-full\\\" src=\\\"http:\/\/blog.ktmonline.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2018\/03\/sony-xperia-XZ2-compact.jpg\\\" alt=\\\"\\\" width=\\\"400\\\" height=\\\"400\\\" \/>(<em>the Xperia XZ2 Compact)<\/em><\/p>\n<p><b>The Tech.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The larger XZ2 features 5.2 inch display houses a Full HD HDR display which in testing produces very clear images with vibrant colours. The Compact version is much smaller at just 5 inches but features the same technology, and both phones come with TRILUMINOS display for mobile, hence the impressive results.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Sony\u2019s dynamic vibration system, which they have quite heavily pushed in marketing, is underwhelming, so don\u2019t expect much from that. We do feel, however, that Sony Bravia TV technology and powerful stereo speakers make for a decent viewing experience; if your planing on downloading apps like Netflix and Amazon Video then you won\u2019t be disappointed. It so good, in fact, that we recommended the XZ2 as our perfect smartphone for film enthusiasts <a href=\"http:\/\/blog.ktmonline.co.uk\/the-best-smartphones-for-film-buffs-sony-xperia-xz2\/\\\">here. <\/a><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The non-removable 3180mAh battery means that the Xperia XZ2 has come up on top in terms of battery life, with experts rating it highly even when placed against the likes of Samsung and Apple. The XZ2 Compact, unsurprisingly, houses a much smaller 2870 mAh battery, so if you\u2019re admittedly always on your smartphone, you may want to go for the larger handset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Both handsets run on what Sony claims to be their fastest processor yet, the Qualcomm Snapdragon 845 which we found in testing to be more than suitable if you\u2019re looking for a speedy and responsive smartphone. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Camera.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Both the XZ2 and the XZ2 Compact feature a 19MP Motion Eye camera which allegedly reacts to its surroundings much like the human eye. This really is an impressive camera set up, particularly on a compact smartphone, so any photography enthusiasts will be impressed with what Sony have managed to do here. In addition both phones have the capacity to record 4K video and super slow motion footage at 960 frames per second in full 1080p HD quality, so you can capture all of your most important memories in the highest quality.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><b>The Price.<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">You can currently get your hands on the Sony Xperia XZ2 for \u00a3685 SIM free, while the Xperia XZ2 Compact is significantly cheaper at \u00a3489. That\u2019s quite a difference, but when you consider the difference in size and battery power, we can almost see why &#8211; but we were still very impressed with the XZ2 Compact, so don\u2019t disregard it if you\u2019re not a heavy smartphone user, particularly if you\u2019re after a smaller handset.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">All of that aside, you can get hold of both handsets on great value pay monthly contracts with some great added extras. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Sony-Xperia-XZ2-Compact?\\\">XZ2 Compact<\/a> contracts start at as little as \u00a333 per month, with the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Sony-Xperia-XZ2?\\\">XZ2<\/a> available for a tiny bit more at \u00a339 per month. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Whichever handset you go for, both are impressive pieces of tech, and prove that Sony aren\\&#8217;t quite ready to be overlooked when it comes to smartphone technology.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Here at Fonehouse we can\u2019t help but feel that Sony have been somewhat overlooked in recent years.
