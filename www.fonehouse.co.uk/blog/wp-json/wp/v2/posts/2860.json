Not only do they have a following of loyal followers across the globe, but they also manage to stir up a wild frenzy of speculation every time a rumoured new iPhone release emerges.<\/p>\n<p>When talk started around the release of 2017, everyone knew that something special was on its way to celebrate the ten year anniversary since the launch of the very first iPhone handset. And so the iPhone X was announced.<\/p>\n<p>But because of this hyped up launch from the company, the other releases of 2017 became somewhat overshadowed, despite the fact that they were extremely well received by experts. Indeed, the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus arrived as possibly the most low-key, understated iPhone releases ever, but there\u2019s no reason you should overlook them.<\/p>\n<p>In particular, the iPhone 8 Plus is an outstanding handset that has received five-star reviews from a number of credible sources, and we can\u2019t help but feel that it deserves a little bit more attention. Even better, it\u2019s now here in red.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Apple iPhone 8 Plus Build and Design<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The iPhone 8 Plus features a stunning all-glass design that breaks away slightly from the traditional brushed finish that we\u2019ve seen in recent years. It also features an aerospace grade aluminium band that is perfectly colour matched to the stunning, vibrant red that really makes this handset stand out from the rest.<\/p>\n<p>The red iPhone 8 Plus is just one in a long line of iPhones that come in an exclusive as part of the PROJECT(RED) charity collaboration.<\/p>\n<p>Apple has been partnering with (RED) for over 11 years in an effort to support HIV and AIDS programmes that work to provide schemes such as counselling, tests and meds to prevent the transmission of HIV from a pregnant mother to her unborn child.<\/p>\n<p>All of this is to work towards an AIDS-free generation in the world, and so far Apple has raised over $160 million to donate towards this brilliant cause.<\/p>\n<p>Aside from the fact that (RED) is a highly worthy cause, the red iPhone 8 Plus looks beautiful. On top of that, it is also water and dust resistant and feels extremely solid and durable.<\/p>\n<p>Like most Plus models, it is difficult to use with just one hand, however, if you\u2019re a seasoned iPhone Plus user then this won\u2019t be an issue for you.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Apple iPhone 8 Plus Screen Quality<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The 5.5-inch Retina HD display of the iPhone 8 Plus is exactly the same as that featured on the 7 Plus model, but don\u2019t let that put you off. This display is second to none and we would even go as far to say it knocks the Samsung S8+ out of the park.<\/p>\n<p>The viewing experience on this display really is exceptional; colours are rich and bold, yet retain a natural feel, and True Tone technology means that the 8 Plus automatically adjusts its white balance to match the light around you. So wherever you\u2019re reading important content, relaxing with an eBook or watching your favourite TV show, you can do so without worrying about glare or darkness.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Apple iPhone 8 Plus Sound Quality<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>If the screen was the top display of 2017, we\u2019d have to say that sound quality reflects that too; audio on the iPhone 8 Plus is a brilliant feature that doesn\u2019t get enough credit.<\/p>\n<p>Even though there\u2019s still no support for hi-resolution music, we really can\u2019t fault the sound quality with this handset. With opulent bass, incredible texture to all musical instruments and dynamic expression elsewhere, the audio experience with the iPhone 8 Plus cannot be beaten (so far at least).<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s still a notable absence of the headphone jack, but if you\u2019re upgrading from another iPhone handset then you\u2019ll expect this, and it really isn\u2019t an issue once you get yourself sorted with some wireless headphones or earpods. Plus, if you do want to stick to your guns and keep your traditional headphones, then you can use them with the headphone adapter that plugs into the charging slot.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Apple iPhone 8 Plus Features<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Critics have raved about the camera setup on the iPhone 8 Plus.<\/p>\n<p>In all honesty, it features many of the same features as the camera on the iPhone 7 Plus, but we can\u2019t say we\u2019re even bothered by this.<\/p>\n<p>There are, however, some subtle changes. The iPhone 8 Plus features a dual 12MP camera with a wide angle and telephoto lens. The difference being that with this handset we get a larger, faster sensor which means an improved performance in low-lighting, as well as an improved colour filter and deeper pixels. All of this combines to deliver photographs that feature sharper details and vivid colours.<\/p>\n<p>One of our favourite features on the iPhone 7 Plus was the innovative Portrait Mode, and Apple has made this much-loved addition even better on the 8 Plus, meaning that the Bokeh effect that users can add to their photos looks even more natural and gives that great impact that you want in your portraits.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Apple iPhone 8 Plus Performance<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>Although the iPhone 8 Plus is significantly cheaper than the more premium iPhone X, it still features much of the same internal hardware.<\/p>\n<p>Like the X, the 8 Plus runs on the A11 chip, which Apple has hailed as the \u2018most powerful and smartest chip ever in a smartphone\u2019. The A11 chip does indeed deliver a speedy smartphone experience, and using multiple apps or programs doesn\u2019t bring about any form of delay.<\/p>\n<p>The battery life of the iPhone 8 Plus is also impressive. Longtime fans will be relieved to hear that with the 8 Plus you can often find yourself with power to spare at the end of the day, as this is often a sore point for Apple fans. But no, the iPhone 8 Plus has a great battery life, and you\u2019ll definitely notice a difference from previous models.<\/p>\n<p>Another great upgrade is the ability to use wireless charging thanks to the glass back of the new design. Put simply, wireless charging just makes life a little easier; it\\&#8217;s not essential, but it is a luxury that we experts really appreciate in a high-end smartphone.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Fonehouse\u2019s iPhone 8 Plus Opinion<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The (RED) edition of the iPhone 8 Plus has to be one of our favourite iPhone handsets. Not only does it look absolutely stunning, but it feels ultra durable and contributes to an incredibly worthy cause.<\/p>\n<p>The iPhone 8 Plus features a stunning display that delivers bold colours and impressive True Tone technology, making the viewing experience with this handset almost unbeatable.<\/p>\n<p>Even though the audio experience with iPhones is often overlooked, we were really impressed with the iPhone 8 Plus and would go as far to say it\u2019s one of our favourite smartphones for sound quality.<\/p>\n<p>The camera setup is similar to the iPhone 7 Plus, but Apple has made enough subtle differences to deliver a smartphone camera that will deliver photographs that will never fail to impress.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s generous of Apple to grant the iPhone 8 models the same chipset as the more expensive iPhone X, as the A11 chip really does deliver a great performance. The extended battery life doesn\u2019t go unappreciated, and having power to spare at the end of the day is a luxury that we\u2019re not always used to with iPhone handsets.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>Fonehouse\u2019s\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/iPhone-8-Plus-64GB\\\">Best iPhone 8 Plus Deals<\/a><\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>At Fonehouse we\u2019re proud to be one of the UK\u2019s best independent mobile phone retailers, and we will always endeavour to bring you the very best mobile phone deals.<\/p>\n<p>The iPhone 8 Plus isn\u2019t the cheapest of smartphones, so we\u2019re delighted to bring you some of the very best iPhone deals on the market.<\/p>\n<p>We have some of the very best Vodafone iPhone 8 Plus deals, with great additional perks including entertainment subscription to the likes of Spotify, Now TV and Sky Sports.<\/p>\n<p>Or, if you\u2019re looking for an EE pay monthly contract, we\u2019re proud to bring some of the best iPhone 8 Plus offers on EE, giving you bags of data and even the odd cashback offer!<\/p>\n<p>If you\u2019re looking for the iPhone 8 Plus SIM free, then you\u2019ll be happy to know that we have some of the lowest SIM-free prices, and with our next day delivery service, you could have your iPhone 8 Plus the very next day for not a penny more.<\/p>\n<p>If you can\u2019t find the best iPhone 8 Plus deal online or in our stores, contact our team on 0333 900 1133 and our UK based customer service team will be on hand to guide you to the perfect deal for you.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Many feel that Apple are now the undisputed giants of the smartphone world, and it\\&#8217;s easy to understand why.
