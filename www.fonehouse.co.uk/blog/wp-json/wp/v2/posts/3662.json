It can be a frightening world, and you will worry when they\\&#8217;re young and venturing out into it for the first time. However, it can reassure you to know where they are and what they\\&#8217;re doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Tracking the phone of your son is something which you can do in certain situations. Knowing how to do it is where people trip up. If you don\\&#8217;t care about being an \\&#8217;uncool\\&#8217; parent, or you\\&#8217;re just worried about them and want to exercise your right as their parent, we\\&#8217;ll be looking at how you can do that.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Tracking Applications<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">One of the first ways that you can track the phone of your child is through tracking applications. These are apps which are specifically for looking out for your kid and figuring out where they are and what they\\&#8217;re doing.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Typically, this works via GPS. All phones transmit a signal when they\\&#8217;re switched on. It\\&#8217;s how they can connect to the network and get the coverage to call and make texts. So you can use this signal to figure out where they are. The level of detail provided can vary. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In some instances, you\\&#8217;ll find that they provide you with the location of your child\\&#8217;s phone. In other situations, you\\&#8217;ll notice that you get information about where they\\&#8217;ve been, and even an option to listen to their conversations when they\\&#8217;re not answering your calls to make sure that they\\&#8217;re okay.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Software Native to the Phone<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">A lot of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\\\">modern smartphones<\/a> have software for tracking built into them already. The major companies recognise that the typical user of a smartphone isn\\&#8217;t always going to be someone who is above the age of 18 and so they have planned accordingly. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">What you will find is that there\\&#8217;s a lot of software that exists on the phone already to make sure that you can track your child should you need to. Find my iPhone is a useful tool, and Android users will also have access to the Family Link app. This technology works by downloading it, going into the Settings and following the instructions to locate the device of your child. It\\&#8217;s helpful when you both have phones from the same family. You would be wise to consider getting them a model from within the Android range for this very reason. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In summary, there\\&#8217;s a lot of ways that you can track the phone of your child if you feel that there is a need to. So many people become obsessed with finding out what their child is doing and how safe they are, which is why there are applications to facilitate this investigation. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">It\\&#8217;s always natural to want to protect your kids. When you\\&#8217;re worried about them, the best thing to do can often be to make sure you work with them and teach them about being safe, but options like these are a good backup plan. You have to be very careful that you don\\&#8217;t damage their trust in you. <\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We understand what it means to be naturally protective of a child.
