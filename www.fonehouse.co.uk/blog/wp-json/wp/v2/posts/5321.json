As people start to rely on their smartphones more and more, they appreciate the ability to use their phones at all times. Whether they\u2019re snapping memories poolside, looking at a recipe while cooking, or watching videos while washing up \u2013 having the peace of mind that your phone is safe from splashes is key.<\/p>\n<p>Apple has made hints at the water resistance of the new iPhone 12 line up, with photos of the smartphones being splashed, but many aren\u2019t sure how waterproof it actually is.<\/p>\n<p>Hence, the question on everyone\u2019s lips \u2013 is the iPhone 12 waterproof or not? Don\u2019t worry we\u2019ve got the answers you need.<\/p>\n<p>Looking for the best iPhone 12 deals? View all our\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/iphone-12-pro-5g\">iPhone 12 deals<\/a>.<\/p>\n<h2>About the iPhone 12<\/h2>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>There are plenty of things to love about the iPhone 12, but is its water resistance one of them?<\/p>\n<p>2020 brought us the Apple iPhone 12 range, and, with it, OLED displays, 5G connectivity, the A14 chip, improved cameras, and MagSafe. This range has 3 different models, the standard iPhone 12, the Pro variant and the Pro Max addition. As with other recent models, the back of the iPhone 12 is made from glass, with the two halves of the device sandwiching an aerospace-grade aluminium enclosure that comes in six colours: blue, green, black, white, red, and purple.<\/p>\n<p>The iPhone 12 models were the first to support 5G connectivity for faster downloads and uploads, better quality video streaming, improved gaming, and higher definition 1080p FaceTime calls.<\/p>\n<p>The iPhone 12 models also offer IP68 water and dust resistance and can hold up to submersion in 6 meters of water for up to 30 minutes. But the question \u2018is the iPhone 12 waterproof?\u2019 has been hotly debated. Thankfully, we\u2019re here to put all your minds at ease with this article which outlines whether the iPhone 12 really is as waterproof as Apple claims.<\/p>\n<h2>What is an IP rating?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>Before we get onto answering \u2018is the iPhone 12 waterproof?\u2019, let\u2019s discuss what an IP rating actually is.<\/p>\n<p>An IP rating is the official certification given to a mobile phone once it has been tested against dust and liquid resistance. A smartphone will only be tested for this rating if the manufacturer believes it will add value to the product.<\/p>\n<p>So, it\u2019s likely that if a phone isn\u2019t water resistant at all, it won\u2019t be tested and won\u2019t have an IP rating. This doesn\u2019t always mean it isn\u2019t resistant, it just hasn\u2019t been confirmed. Even once a phone has an IP rating, it can still be damaged by water. Every single IP rating will have different limitations, especially when it comes down to the resistance against liquids.<\/p>\n<h2>How water resistant is the iPhone 12?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>So, we know the Apple iPhone 12 enjoys an IP rating of IP68, but what does that mean? Don\u2019t worry we\u2019ve got it covered.<\/p>\n<p>Given that the iPhone 12 range has been IP tested, we can be sure that it has some impressive capabilities when it comes to water. Each year, we see Apple expand the limits of its smartphones so that you can use them in water for longer periods of time.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s not just about water resistance, though \u2013 the \u20186\u2019 of the IP68 rating relates to how dust resistant the iPhone 12 is. 6 is actually the highest rating for dust-resistance so, thanks to this certification, you know the iPhone 12 is completely protected against small particles. Of course, we would still always recommend cleaning out any ports and speakers on your Apple smartphone.<\/p>\n<p>That means that the \u20188\u2019 of the IP68 rating refers to the water resistance of the iPhone 12. So, according to this rating, is the iPhone 12 waterproof? In this case, the iPhone 12 should be able to be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes. If you push this time limit, water is likely to seep into the phone and cause a whole lot of damage. Once the damage has been caused, there\u2019s no way of fixing it and you would have to buy a new phone.<\/p>\n<p>In addition to this time limit, you can only take the iPhone 12 to a maximum of 4 metres in depth. However, this is deeper than the average swimming pool so unless you plan on deep sea diving, this shouldn\u2019t be a concern.<\/p>\n<h2>Is the Apple iPhone 12 waterproof?<\/h2>\n<p><strong>\u00a0<\/strong>In short, the answer to, \u2018is the Apple iPhone 12 waterproof?\u2019, is no. The iPhone 12 is not waterproof, but it is water resistant. That means, it should be totally fine if you accidentally drop it in the pool or it gets splashed with liquid.<\/p>\n<p>To date, there is no smartphone that is considered 100% waterproof. However, with an IP68 rating, the iPhone 12 is one of the most water-resistant smartphones.<\/p>\n<p>But you can never be too safe when it comes to your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/brand\/apple-mobile-phone-deals\">iPhone<\/a>. It\u2019s important to note that the water resistance of the iPhone 12 will degrade over time. And, liquid damage isn\u2019t covered under Apple\u2019s warranty, so you\u2019ll have to purchase a new phone if it breaks.<\/p>\n<p>So, now you know the answer to, \u2018is the iPhone 12 waterproof?\u2019, why not go ahead and buy it?
