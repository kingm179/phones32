Whether you\u2019re doing your food shopping or on a train , these phones will not let you miss out.<\/p>\n<p>We\u2019ve looked at a range of phones, from all different manufacturers. These are the best mobile phones for streaming.<\/p>\n<h2>Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max<\/h2>\n<p>A very new phone to the scene and a huge improvement from Apple. People are absolutely loving the iPhone 11 series!<\/p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/apple-iphone-11-pro-max\">iPhone 11 Pro Max<\/a> is very similar to the iPhone XS Max in design, with a few added extras. On offer is a 6.5-inch, super retina XDR OLED display. This screen is also supported by 16M colours, meaning you will feel as if it\u2019s so real.<\/p>\n<p>Like any Apple phone, the audio is spot on and this phone is no exception. The speakers don\u2019t allow room for distortion or crackling so, you will be able to hear the crowd cheering as if you were in the stadium.<\/p>\n<h2>Sony Xperia 5<\/h2>\n<p>If you\u2019re even the slightest bit into mobile phones, we don\u2019t need to say anything to know this phone is brilliant at streaming. Sony is known for the quality of the display and audio. You would hope they were good phones, seeing as they produce all our favourite films too!<\/p>\n<p>There\u2019s a lot we could say about the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/sony-xperia-5\">Xperia 5<\/a> screen, so we\u2019ll try to keep it short. This handset is slightly smaller than any others we have mentioned, with a 6.1-inch FHD+ HDR OLED display. To make up with this, Sony have given it\u2019s customers a 21:9 CinemaWide display, the same ratio as the screens of your favourite cinemas. You will not find a picture as clear as one on this phone.<\/p>\n<p>Again, we would be slightly worried if the audio wasn\u2019t quite right on Sony mobile phones. This mobile has been crammed with the best of the best in the sense of speakers, Dolby Atmos Stereo speakers. Anyone will be stunned at the quality of audio given on a mobile phone, I mean, who would have thought you could feel so immersed?<\/p>\n<h2>Samsung Galaxy Note 10 Plus<\/h2>\n<p>Samsung\u2019s Note series has always been a mobile phone that is brilliant for streaming, due to it\u2019s large screen-size. This years revamped Note 10 Plus is not one to let us down. We were given an improved display, better speakers and amazing AMOLED.<\/p>\n<p>The Note 10 Plus display has increased to a 6.8-inch, the full size of the Note 8, with incredible detail thanks to the infinity, AMLOED display. The vibrant colours, brilliant for editing pictures or watching your favourite videos, will absolutely knock you off your feet; perfect for any kind of streaming.<\/p>\n<p>We have not been let down by Samsung when it comes to the audio on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-note-10-plus\">Galaxy Note 10 Plus<\/a> either. This phone offers a crystal-clear sound experience with no interference and is perfect to pull you into any sporting event. If you\u2019re lucky enough to have a pair of wireless Samsung headphones, you\u2019ll also be able to enjoy the event privately.<\/p>\n<h2>Huawei P30 Pro<\/h2>\n<p>The audio standard on Huawei is always very high and you won\u2019t get over the audio on the P30 Pro particularly fast. This is another phone that is supported by Dolby Atmos sound to ensure you are absorbed for the entire use of the phone.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/huawei-p30-pro\">Huawei\u2019s P30 Pro<\/a> is completely bezel free, meaning you are given a full 6.47-inch, infinity OLED screen, outstanding for streaming. If the punch hole camera is really annoying you, pop your phone into full-screen mode and enjoy a complete screen. Alongside all these pros already listed, you\u2019ll be given a home theatre feel with an aspect ration of 9.5:9.<\/p>\n<h2>OnePlus 7 Pro 5G<\/h2>\n<p>Of course, we have to throw a 5G phone in here. How could we not? 5G was made for streaming! You will be able to avoid buffering meaning won\u2019t be frustrated when you miss England\u2019s first try in the final.<\/p>\n<p>Alongside all other favoured mobiles this year, the One Plus 7 Pro has a 6.41-inch infinity display. Not an inch of space has been wasted on such a clean looking handset. This phone also includes 16M colours so don\u2019t fall off that train seat with surprise! You will not be disappointed in the slightest.<\/p>\n<p>OnePlus have given this mobile phone an amazing audio system. The phone holds Dolby Atmos stereo speakers as well! Therefore, you can throw yourself into any sporting event with a great view, great sounds and no buffering!<\/p>\n<p>Whether you\u2019re an iOS fan or an Android lover, we\\&#8217;ve got the best mobile phones for streaming. Don\u2019t miss the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.itv.com\/rugbyworldcup2019\/\">Rugby World Cup Final<\/a>, wherever you are!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Whether you\u2019re out doing your food shopping or on a long train road, you\u2019re going to want one of the best mobile phones to stream on.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4525,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"categories":[26],"tags":[54,175,190,206,297,298,347,361,425,434],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.3 -
