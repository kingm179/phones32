These are bound to improve your experience on the S20 and even make it feel more like your phone. There are tricks that can do almost anything when it comes to smartphones.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Change in Settings<\/h2>\n<p>There are a few different settings you can change on your S20 to give it a slightly different feel overall. One of these settings changes includes creating your own power button. On previous Samsung devices, we\u2019ve seen the power button sitting on the edge of the phone however, this has been converted to the Bixby button. To change it back, all you need to do is swipe down to reveal the control centre and tap the standby icon. At the bottom of the page, you\u2019ll see \u2018Side Key Settings\u2019, tap this and simply tap \u2018Power off menu\u2019.<\/p>\n<p>Another change in settings can allow you to activate the gesture navigation buttons. Samsung tend to have their navigation buttons right at the bottom of the screen. By heading to Settings &gt; Display &gt; Navigation Bar and selecting full screen, you can use the gestures anywhere to get around your Samsung Galaxy S20. This makes for a far smoother one handed experience. By swiping anywhere on the screen, you can access the home screen, multitasking screen or even go back on the web. This little trick will save you a lot of time, and stretching.<\/p>\n<p>Something that\u2019s new to the S20 is Samsung Daily. This is essentially a small feed that shows you the news, new things coming to Netflix or even the weather. A Lot of the time, this is the latest news and takes a while to update. For that reason, several users much prefer to turn it off and avoid notifications. To turn it off, long press on your home screen and swipe to the right. At the top of this window, you\u2019ll see a small toggle next to Samsung Daily. Just turn this off to avoid any notifications.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Personalise your Samsung Galaxy S20<\/h2>\n<p>One thing that\u2019s clear to see is that the S20 has a far larger screen. This makes you think that you can expect more room, however that\u2019s not the case. Samsung have in fact increased the size of the icons on the screen to fill it up. Don\u2019t worry though, this can be changed. To change this, simply long press on the home screen until the multitasking window pops up. Along the bottom, you\u2019ll see a few options, tap \u2018Home Screen Settings\u2019. Select either \u2018Home Screen Grid\u2019 or \u2018App Screen Grid\u2019 and change the size of the icons to your preference.<\/p>\n<p>Currently, when you want to see your notifications on the Samsung Galaxy S20, you need to swipe down from the top of the screen. For a more simple and efficient way to open your notifications, you can change settings. These settings will allow you to swipe anywhere on the screen to open the centre. First, long press on the home screen and head back into the \u2018Home Screen Settings\u2019. Scroll down until you come across \u2018Swipe down for notification panel\u2019. Simply make sure you turn the toggle on and you\u2019ll be able to swipe down from anywhere.<\/p>\n<p>Something that can be a huge change for anyone moving over from an iPhone is that all your apps are no longer on the home screen. This can be changed. If you want to show all your app icons on your home screen, all you need to do is head back to the \u2018Home Screen Settings\u2019 and choose \u2018Home Screen Layout\u2019. There are only two options here so selecting \u2018 Home Screen Only\u2019 will transfer all your apps to your home screen. This does also get rid of the app screen so you won\u2019t have two different faces.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>A few more tips for the Samsung Galaxy S20<\/h2>\n<p>When you first receive the Galaxy, it\u2019s going to come locked to portrait. This means that when you turn your phone sideways, nothing will happen. It\u2019s pretty standard for smartphone users to keep their phone locked to portrait for the majority of the time they\u2019re using it. For anyone who does want to use landscape mode, we can tell you how. All you need to do is long press on the home screen and tap \u2018Home Screen Settings\u2019. Scroll down the options until you come across \u2018Rotate to Landscape Mode\u2019. Now, rotating the phone will rotate the screen too.<\/p>\n<p>If you are using the app screen to store all your apps, they\u2019re automatically stored in order of how they\u2019re downloaded. This can be a bit of an inconvenience but there is also a way to rearrange it. To do this, open up the app grid and tap the 3 dots in the top corner. This will open up a drop menu with a few different options, just select \u2018Sort\u2019. Here, you\u2019ll be able to order your apps alphabetically or use your own customer order. Automatically, your apps will sort themselves out and stay like that until you choose to change it .<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Fun Tricks to Know<\/h2>\n<p>A feature that is much loved in the Samsung Galaxy S20 is the under display fingerprint sensor. This allows for a super easy and secure entry to the phone whilst also being completely invisible. One thing not many people know is you can actually light up the fingerprint sensor for when you want to use it. To activate this, open Settings &gt; Biometrics and Security &gt; Fingerprints. You will need to type in the pin that you previously set up on your phone. Scroll down and select \u2018Show Icon When Screen is Off\u2019. You can change the settings to suit what you want.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Of course, these are all tricks specific to the S20.
