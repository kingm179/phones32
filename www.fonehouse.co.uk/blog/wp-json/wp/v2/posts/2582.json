A lot of users still prefer to hang back from the latest models as these tend to be more expensive. iPhone 7 is a great choice when it comes to upgrading your phone or <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Paymonthly\\\">getting a new pay monthly contract<\/a>, and there are lots of reasons why.<\/p>\n<h3>High End Technology<\/h3>\n<p>Apple have a really strong reputation for producing high end mobile phones that are packed with features and aesthetically pleasing. \u00a0They have been popular since the first iPhone was released just over 10 years ago. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/iPhone-7-32GB\\\">The iPhone 7<\/a> has now been around for a year or so and has proven itself a worthy contender for one of the most popular handsets. \u00a0What is even better is that thanks to the range of deals we have managed to secure there are several contracts that will allow you to have a brand new iPhone 7 with no upfront cost.<\/p>\n<h3>Feature Packed<\/h3>\n<p>While the iPhone 7 may not have all the features seen on the later models it still packs a cracking punch. \u00a0It features fingerprint ID and features Apple\u2019s in-house A10 Fusion 64-bit system-on-chip. \u00a0This not only makes the phone really fast and massively responsive but it features four power cores which are designed to enhance battery life with only two ever in use at any one time. This is a really easy phone to have out and about all day and still have some battery left when you get home.<\/p>\n<h3>No Upfront Cost<\/h3>\n<p>Having a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/Paymonthly\\\">phone with no upfront cost<\/a> means that you get to own the iPhone 7 without having to pay for the handset in the beginning. \u00a0Naturally this means that the cost of the phone has been added to the mobile tariff but the rates are often so reasonable that it is easy to accommodate in your monthly budget. This means you just pay the monthly contract fee for the duration of the term and the phone is yours.<\/p>\n<p>We have also partnered with two amazing networks who have some extra incentives to really sweeten the deal. Many of the deals also offer a cash back option which reduces the monthly payment even further so owning a brand new iPhone 7 could be as cheap as just \u00a336 a month when the cash back deal is applied.<\/p>\n<h3>Bonus Gifts<\/h3>\n<p>Both EE and Vodafone also offer some really excellent extras to customers who choose certain tariffs. \u00a0These range from Sky Sports offers to Apple Music offers and lots of other lovely television, music and travel options to boot. \u00a0This means that not only can you enjoy an iPhone 7 at no upfront cost but you can also take advantage of these amazing benefits. All that remains is for you to decide on the best level of data, text and call allowance and pick a deal that suits your pocket.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to mobile phone pay monthly contracts, iPhone still remains one of the most popular choices.
