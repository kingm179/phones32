Samsung really surprised the entire tech world by releasing 3 handsets that are compatible with 5G. To be completely honest, it was needed! There weren\u2019t a huge range of 5G compatible phones on the market. The release of 3 major handsets from one of the top tech companies opens the opportunity of more people joining the 5G movement. It really is exciting to see where it will take things.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Samsung Galaxy S20 5G Features<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">One of the first things you\u2019ll notice from the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-s20-5g\\\">Galaxy S20 5G<\/a> is the colour options available. You can purchase this phone in Cosmic Grey, Cloud Blue or Cloud Pink. This makes this handset a great choice for people looking for something a little more fun and people on the search for something way more understated! Gorilla Glass 6, on the front and back, gives this phone a super sleek, professional feel whilst still being really protective. We would still recommend getting a case and screen protector just in case.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">A whole load of fantastic camera features will mean you can get crisper, more vibrant and more artistic photos than any other smartphone. The quad-camera allows up to 30x hybrid optic zoom so you can bring the world to your feet. Partnered with Super Resolution Zoom and AI, we\u2019re sure you won\u2019t lose a single spec of detail. You won\u2019t need to worry about pushing your way through a bustling crowd to get the perfect photo anymore. Night Mode has also had a massive upgrade so you can shoot throughout the entire day. A larger sensor has been built into the camera so your low-light photos will have more colour and be far sharper than they previously were.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Samsung S20 Plus Features<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-5g\\\">Samsung Galaxy S20 Plus<\/a> comes in Cosmic Black, Cosmic Grey and Cloud Blue, perfect for a range of people. This entirely understated, yet attractive, handset reaches out to professionals whilst offering a fun side too. Samsung\u2019s smooth style is upheld by the Gorilla Glass 6 on both the front and back of the phone. All this is boasted through the 6.7-inch dynamic AMOLED 2x capacitive display, which also supports 16M colours. Every single shadow, highlight and colour on your screen will be bursting with vibrancy and it\u2019s full potential will be pulled out.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Users are bound to be completely blown away with the battery life this phone will give you. Built with a non-removable Li-Po 4500 mAh battery, you will get more than ever before out of your phone. You\u2019ll be able to browse, stream and work from your phone without needing to charge for longer than you ever have. For times your Samsung S20 Plus does need a quick boost, you\u2019ll be able to make use of the fast charging feature installed to make your life so much easier.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">If none of this is enough to wow you, just wait until you see exactly what the camera can do. Samsung has leapt into the future with a quad-lens camera, capable of nothing ever seen before. A 12MP wide lens, 64MP telephoto lens, 12MP ultra-wide lens and a 0.3MP depth lens will completely jump out at everyone. The telephoto lens means that your photos will be super sharp and every single detail will pop.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">S20 5G or S20 Plus Prices?<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Prices between the Samsung S20 5G and S20 Plus don\u2019t really differ as much as you think they would. The Galaxy S20 5G is slightly cheaper both for SIM free and pay monthly contracts. You can get them on some amazing 5G ready contracts with really high data packages and some great entertainment packages. Of course, you need to make sure you\u2019re getting a 5G ready contract or you won\u2019t be able to make full use of your phones capabilities.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">If some deals just aren\u2019t as good of a price as you would have hoped, there are amazing cashback deals on offer. These will save you some serious money and are actually super simple. Automatic cashback will always be a lesser amount but will be paid into your bank account without you needing to do anything. Redemption cashback can be really high amounts but you do have to claim them using your monthly bills.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Deciding which network to join can be super difficult, especially when they all offer such enticing packages. The first step to making that important decision would be checking which networks has the best coverage in your area. You can do this through their online coverage checkers.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Whether you prefer the S20 5G or S20 Plus is entirely dependent on what you\u2019re looking for from a phone and how much you\u2019re willing to spend. Either way, these are two amazing phones from Samsung.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In February 2020, Samsung announced the release of 4 new phones but we\u2019re here to decide whether the S20 5G or S20 Plus is better.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":4672,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"categories":[527],"tags":[347,377,378],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.3 -
