Not only is this one of the best priced <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/brand\/apple-mobile-phone-deals\">iPhones<\/a> but, it\u2019s also one of Apple\u2019s best designed and built phones too. Here are our top 5 iPhone 11 tricks:<\/p>\n<ol>\n<li>The Ultra Wide Camera<\/li>\n<li>Slofie<\/li>\n<li>QuickTake<\/li>\n<li>Gesture features<\/li>\n<li>Camera tricks<\/li>\n<\/ol>\n<h2>1. Ultra Wide Camera<\/h2>\n<p>As we all know already, the iPhone 11 camera has had a bit of a makeover and is now even more impressive than it already was. There are two 12MP lenses featured on the back of this smartphone, one being an ultra wide lens. With any ultra wide lens, you\u2019re all to capture more of the scene around you. Whether you\u2019re taking a group photo or capturing a mountain range, it\u2019ll fit more in one frame.<\/p>\n<p>Before you use this option, you do need to activate it. Of course, you don\u2019t always want to take your photos from a wide angle. Opening this setting is super simple. All you need to do is use two fingers to pinch the screen. You\u2019ll see your camera zoom out to the ultra wide lens. Now, you\u2019ll be able to snap your photos with far more visible.<\/p>\n<h2>2. Slofie with the iPhone 11<\/h2>\n<p>Whilst it looks like a typo, it\u2019s not. A slofie is the new feature that can be found on the iPhone 11 series and it\u2019s changing the selfie game. The slofie gives you the ability to record a slow motion video from the front camera. You\u2019ll be able to capture an iconic hair flip or something fun going on in the background easier than ever.<\/p>\n<p>All you need to do is make sure you\u2019re on the right camera setting. Along the bottom of the camera, there are a number of different options, just select the slo-mo option. Of course, you\u2019ll also have to change to the front camera.<\/p>\n<h2>3. iPhone 11 QuickTake<\/h2>\n<p>QuickTake is the feature nobody asked for but everyone needs. This is a life saver! Have you ever been taking a photo and get met with the perfect video opportunity, you swipe to the video settings and it\\&#8217;s too late? Everyone has! <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/brand\/apple-mobile-phone-deals\">Apple iPhone\u2019s<\/a> new feature allows you to press and hold the shutter to record a video. This is a lot like Snapchat and Instagram! You will only be able to record a short video so if you want anything longer, you\u2019ll need to swipe to the video mode.<\/p>\n<h2>4. iPhone 11&#8217;s Gesture Features<\/h2>\n<p>There are actually a few different gesture features added into the iPhone 11 tricks you didn\u2019t know, and we\u2019re going to share them. The first feature is gesture typing. At first, this may not make the most sense as to why it\u2019s a thing. Have you ever been in a rush and texting at the same time? It always comes out as complete gibberish. Gesture typing allows you to type words without ever taking your finger off the screen. You simply swipe your finger from letter to letter.<\/p>\n<p>Another gesture feature that will make your life easier is the text editing gesture. This allows you to edit text without having to delete it. Whilst we were able to do this on many iPhones before, it\u2019s never been this efficient and precise. All you need to do now is tap and move the cursor to the end of the text. You can then edit the text using any regular text editing options.<\/p>\n<h2>5. iPhone 11 Tricks with the Camera<\/h2>\n<p>There are so many different things this camera can do and they\u2019re all pretty impressive. From the different camera lenses to the in-built features, such as portrait mode, they\u2019ll help give you extremely professional or really artistic images.<\/p>\n<p>The first features we\u2019re going to focus on is the front camera. This is a single 12MP camera however, when you do come to use it, you\u2019re not using its full potential. The camera will automatically set to the 7MP lens. All you need to do tap the expand button at the bottom of the screen. This is going to zoom out, giving a bigger picture whilst catching more detail.<\/p>\n<p>Our second iPhone 11 trick you didn\u2019t know with the camera is burst shooting. On previous models, we were able to shake multiple different photos by holding the shutter down. This now works with QuickTake so of course, Apple had to come with a different method. To take burst photos, all you need to do now is swipe left.<\/p>\n<p>Whilst there are so many more camera tricks, the last one we will be covering is recomposing your images. This is a feature that requires a few setting alterations but can help you out in the future. To change these, just head to Settings &gt; Camera &gt; Composition and make sure that the two toggles for \u2018Capture Outside the Frame\u2019 are turned on. This will let you edit your photos and videos to bring images into frame that you may have missed.<\/p>\n<h2>More Tips and Tricks<\/h2>\n<p>Seeing as the list of iPhone 11 tricks is extremely long, we\u2019re going to keep it short and just share a few more of our favourite or most useful features.<\/p>\n<p>Have you ever caught yourself in a busy place, trying to take a video but you can\u2019t hear what you want to hear? Audio zoom allows you to capture the subject sound and blur the background noise. Of course, you do have to zoom in on the subject but, you\u2019ll have the sound you wanted to catch<\/p>\n<p>This is something that may help if you\u2019re worried your phone may be second hand or even repaired. You can often tell when a phone has been repaired by a cheaper third party, rather than Apple. If you want to double check this, you can actually take a look in your settings. Head into Settings &gt; General &gt; About and a warning will appear if this is the case.<\/p>\n<p>With each of these things you didn\u2019t know your iPhone 11 could do, you\u2019re going to be unlocking the true potential of your smartphone.
