Of course, the 5G compatibility is something that sends this smartphone soring. Although this is a top feature, there\u2019s a lot more to love, especially because Nokia is such a reliable manufacturer, and always has been!<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What\u2019s inside the Nokia 8.3?<\/h2>\n<p>Behind every great smartphone, you need a powerful battery and that was definitely top of the list when it comes to the Nokia 8.3. Keeping this thing powered is a 4500mAh battery unit and it\u2019s got some serious kick to it. You\u2019re going to be able to get hours worth of use on just a single charge. It really allows you to go about your day with little to worry about. Better yet, when you do need to charge the phone, it\u2019s compatible with fast charging 18W. This means that you\u2019ll be able to quickly power up this smartphone in just a matter of minutes.<\/p>\n<p>Of course, you\u2019ll also want enough space to keep everything that\u2019s important to you on your mobile phone. With that in mind, the Nokia 8.3 is available in both 64GB and 128GB. Both options are going to allow you to keep a huge amount of data on your mobile phone. The larger option is best for people who keep more apps and photos but both are great. Whether you go for the smaller or the larger option, you\u2019ll be able to add even more storage using a micro SD card. With this feature, you\u2019re able to use endless amounts of memory.<\/p>\n<p>Last but certainly not least, the chipset behind it all. Ensuring that the Nokia 8.3 runs as smoothly as it does is the Snapdragon 765G. This is a 5G chip so with the right 5G ready deal, you\u2019ll be able to get the fastest speeds around. 5G has grown so fast over the last year and a half with more and more compatible smartphones being. You\u2019ll get to experience smooth browsing, clearer images and instant uploads. Not to mention, this chip also helps to ensure that your memory stretches whilst also making your battery even more efficient.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Slick Design<\/h2>\n<p>Touchscreen phones really have taken over the world. They\u2019re offering far more room and responsiveness that keypad phones used to. To ensure you\u2019ve got a great viewing area, the Nokia 8.3 is available with a 6.81 inch IPS LCD display. Whilst offering you loads of space, it also ensures that everything on screen is high quality and easy to see. This display is huge and Nokia has done their best to ensure it stays that way. They\u2019ve reduced all bezels around the edge of the phone and even transformed the selfie camera into a tiny whole in the corner.<\/p>\n<p>The rolled corners really pull this slick experience over to the back of the phone by offering a high end design. You are only able to purchase the Nokia 8.3 in Polar Night. This is a really eye-catching shiny blue colour. When the light catches it, you\u2019ll get a range of different hues across the back of the phone. This is a plastic backing so you get an almost satin finish all over. Don\u2019t worry though, it\u2019s still something to talk about. All that\u2019s on the back of the phone is the camera lens and the Nokia logo, making sure you get to enjoy every last big of this phone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Nokia 8.3 Camera System<\/h2>\n<p>On the back of the Nokia 8.3, you can find a very impressive quad lens camera system. This consists of a 64MP main camera, 12MP ultra wide lens, 2MP macro lens and a 2MP depth sensor. Each of this allows you to get creative in your own sort of way. First of all, the main camera is what you\u2019re going to be using the most. You\u2019re able to get a more regular angle whilst catching more detail than before. The ultra wide lens captures the same level of detail, just with a wider frame. It\u2019s perfect for big group photos so you don\u2019t have to squeeze or even just take photos of the landscape around you.<\/p>\n<p>Both the macro and depth lenses are a lot more interesting to look into. They allow for a completely different shooting style but produce extremely specific images. Starting with the depth lens, you\u2019ll be able to really make your photos pop. With each portrait, the background will be softened, drawing more attention to your subject. Using the macro lens, you\u2019ll be able to zoom right in and photograph items unlike ever before. With nature photos, you\u2019ll be able to spot a few new colours, textures and details, ones you\u2019ve never seen before.<\/p>\n<p>Rolling over to the front of the phone again, you\u2019re able to capture a whole different style of photos, a selfie. In the small camera hole in the corner of the screen, you can find a single 24MP camera. This is what\u2019s going to give you selfies like never before. Capture insane amounts of highlights, shadows and details, all with little work from yourself.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Features to love<\/h2>\n<p>There are so many different features to love with the Nokia 8.3, from the camera to what\u2019s keeping it going. One feature we\u2019ve seen constantly improving on smartphones is the fingerprint scanner. On the 8.3, you can use a side mounted fingerprint sensor to enter your phone. It\u2019s super secure and set to specific fingers. You can set up a few different fingerprints or just have yours to access your phone securely. There is also the chance to use a passcode however, this is a much more high tech option.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>After unboxing the Nokia 8.3, we know you\u2019re going to be dying to get your hands on it.
