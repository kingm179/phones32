Big things are expected of the new release, with Apple\u2019s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, Greg Joswiak, commenting that \u201cthe new purple finish, just in time for spring, adds another bright and fun option to the lineup, and we think customers are going to love it.\u201d<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h3><i>\\&#8221;Apple always create demand. This device is no different. It\u2019s powerful and bold. Every tweak and change Apple introduce is always popular, this new colour looks brilliant, our customers will be after it \u2013 as will my wife!\\&#8221;<\/i> \u2013 Michael (Store Manager), Fonehouse Belfast<\/h3>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><b>Why purple? Why not!<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Apple are known for their bright and vibrant finishes and this new purple design joins a snazzy list of fun options in what is an already colourful listing. It contains a range of fantastic features such as an advanced dual-camera system that delivers powerful computational photography and the highest-quality video in a smartphone, expansive edge-to-edge Super Retina XDR displays with OLED for an enhanced, brighter look and a Ceramic Shield front cover which provides the biggest jump in durability ever on an iPhone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">All of this compliments the stunning flat-edge aluminum feel, perfectly colour-matched to the precision-milled black glass and more immersive viewing experience, not to mention its high-powered wireless charging with MagSafe and an all-new ecosystem of accessories that can be easily attached.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" title=\"iPhone 12 - Now in Purple\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/eFbA9M8g6FE?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><b>Throwing it back<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Its launch was unveiled at the same time as new brightly iMac computers, available in a rainbow of seven different shades, as Apple add a splash of colour to their collection of marketing-leading devices. The promotional video used to announce the new purple products provided a throwback to earlier purple iMac variations and expressed \u2018delicious like candy\u2019 messaging which alluded to Willy Wonka and the famous purple factory the character owned and colourful clothing he\u2019s often associated with.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In a moment when people are constantly looking back to nostalgic periods from time gone by, Apple have really hit the \u2018sweet spot\u2019 with their new purple finish which just exudes positive vibes and vibrancy \u2013 and when do we ever not need some of that!<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>What else makes the purple iPhone 12 so good?<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Well, where do we start! The durable, elevated, design and immersive display is as beautiful as it is practical, not to mention that the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/iphone-12-mini-5g-64gb-purple\\\">iPhone 12 Mini purple<\/a> is the smallest 5G smartphone in the world, packing intelligent technology into a handy, compact size.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Watching videos or browsing through photos on the go? The immersive HDR viewing experience is perfect for high-definition video and images with enhanced detail and both models have nearly double the peak brightness of the iPhone 11 \u2013 which combined with the new purple finish makes for a delightfully colourful smartphone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">With an industry-leading IP68 rating for water resistance, you can rest easy knowing your device is protected against everyday spills, up to 6 meters and for up to 30 minutes.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Not only that, the Ultra Wide camera and a new Wide camera provides 27% more light for incredible video and photo-taking and ensures brighter pictures and better contrast for images taken in low-light settings with Night mode. <\/span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Order yours with Fonehouse today<\/span><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\"> (insert link) and you can benefit from an end-to-end Dolby Vision experience (the first and only device to provide such a thing), and shoot cinema-grade videos natively on your iPhone.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">With playback on the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/iphone-12-5g-64gb-purple\\\">iPhone 12 Purple<\/a>\u00a0 now more realistic than ever before thanks to the Super Retina XDR display, both models boast improved cinematic video stabilisation and true-to-life selfie videos with Dolby Vision. Other features include longer exposure times for sharper videos, better light trails and smoother exposure in low-light scenarios.<\/span><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><b>Buy today &amp; do your bit for the environment<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Did you know that <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/iphone-12-5g-64gb-purple\\\">iPhone 12<\/a> models are made of 100% recycled rare earth elements in all magnets? This includes the camera, Taptic Engine and MagSafe, as well as Apple\u2019s MagSafe accessories, whilst the power adaptor and EarPods have also been removed from packaging which further reduces carbon emissions and avoids the use and mining of precious materials, allowing for 70% more boxes to be shipped on pallet.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In total, this has cut over two million metric tons of carbon emissions each year which, for context, is similar to taking not far off 450,000 cars from the road annually. So not only can you get your hands on a vivacious new purple-coloured phone, but you can also do your bit for the greater good of the planet.<\/span><\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2><strong><i>\\&#8221;We have already started to receive interest in the new iPhone 12, no changes to the core device but it\u2019s a striking new colour and the fashionistas are keen!\\&#8221; <\/i>\u2013 <\/strong>David (Store Manager), Fonehouse Wokingham<\/h2>\n<\/blockquote>\n<p><b>I\u2019m sold!
