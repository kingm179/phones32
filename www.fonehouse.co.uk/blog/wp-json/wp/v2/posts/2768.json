It did cause a bit of controversy between hardcore apple fanatics but it as also one of the main issues of faults with the common cause of damage being pocket lint going into the jack.<\/p>\n<p>Apple do provide an adapter and the sound is brilliant but there is one drawback. You can\u2019t charge whilst listening to music which is often the most common cause of a drained mobile phone battery.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>iPhone 7 Display<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The device comes with a 4.7-inch screen with 750 x 1334 resolution.

This is a quad core processor which combines two high efficiency and two high performance cores. Apples bold claim stated that this made the iPhone 7 40 percent quicker with improved graphics performance of up to 50 percent.<\/p>\n<p>The iPhone 7 really did make a jump in terms of power. The main reason for the removal of the headphone jack was to place a larger battery in the device. The upgrade in battery does give the iPhone 7 an extra 2 hours over the iPhone 6.<\/p>\n<h3><strong>iPhone 7 Camera<\/strong><\/h3>\n<p>The device comes with 12MP and a wider F1\/8 aperture to give you wider shots.
