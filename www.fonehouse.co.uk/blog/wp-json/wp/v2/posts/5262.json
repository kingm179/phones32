Just like when you get your first car, you\u2019re bound to damage your first phone. That\u2019s why a lot of parents prefer to buy something slightly cheaper whilst their kids are learning to deal with phones as they should.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Samsung Galaxy A71<\/h2>\n<p>As a rather new release, the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/samsung-galaxy-a71\\\">Samsung Galaxy A71<\/a> brings some of the latest features at a much more affordable price. There are two different variants, one being 5G compatible whilst the other isn\u2019t. We\u2019ve included this in our list for the best phones for kids as it\u2019s extremely affordable for what you get. To keep the phone safe, the display is designed with Corning Gorilla Glass 3. This will make smashing the screen that much less likely. Of course, we would also recommend a screen protector for that extra bit of protection.<\/p>\n<p>This device is also top of the list due to the design. With a plastic back, you don\u2019t have to worry about it smashing. That being said, you also get a pretty attractive finish. With a geometric finish when the light hits, your child is bound to fall in love with this. They\u2019ll also have a choice between Prism Crush Black, Prism Crush Silver, Prism Crush Blue and Prism Crush Pink. Having this many colour options allows them to really add their own style to the device, which is sure to make them look after it even more.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Apple iPhone 7<\/h2>\n<p>If you were to ask your child what phone they would like, the most likely answer to come out their mouth will be the newest iPhone. Of course, iPhone\u2019s carry quite the price tag. As new phones are released, old phones drop in price. Released in 2016, the iPhone 7 sits at an extremely affordable price with monthly costs being in the teens. With cashback deals, you can reduce these prices to even lower. Not to mention, with the networks available at Fonehouse, you may even be able to use a few extras for yourself.<\/p>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/apple-iphone-7\\\">Apple iPhone 7<\/a>, you get all the most important features in one place. As this phone still has a home button, your child can enjoy fingerprint access to their phone. This makes the phone slightly more exciting as it would be should it only have passcode access. They\u2019ll also get access to iOS, which is one of the friendliest operating systems around. This means that should they be struggling to do something, it\u2019s more than likely that you\u2019ll be able to figure it out for them. There are so many different things your child is going to love, apart from the fact they\u2019ll have an iPhone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Huawei P30 Lite<\/h2>\n<p>Of course, we have to cover off at least one smartphone from each of the top three manufacturers. Huawei produces a huge amount of handsets, all being great for children in their own way. In 2019, we were given the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/huawei-p30-lite\\\">Huawei P30 Lite<\/a>, which is one of their lower specification phones. Of course, this also makes it cheaper. With extremely high tech features, you child will love this phone. A huge thing they\u2019ll appreciate is the speeds this phone can give out. When they\u2019re playing games, talking to their friends or watching YouTube videos, they\u2019ll be able to do so without interruptions.<\/p>\n<p>Kids love to express themselves through their smartphones nowadays. A great way of them doing this is by taking photos. Lucky for parents, the Huawei P30 Lite doesn\u2019t only have an amazing price, but also an outstanding camera. On the back of the phone is a triple camera consisting of a 48MP main camera, 8MP ultra wide lens and a 2MP depth sensor. Each of these additions to the camera system will allow them to capture photos in the highest quality with great amounts of detail and life like photos.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>iPhone SE<\/h2>\n<p>When we say the iPhone SE is one of the best phones for kids, we mean the up to date one. In 2019, Apple released a new and improved iPhone SE, which holds all the best of the old SE and all the best of modern technology. This is the perfect iPhone for your kids if you\u2019re willing to pay a little more, but not break the bank. Reintroducing a smaller screen means the phone\u2019s far smaller too. With a smaller device, you don\u2019t have to worry about it falling out of pockets or even not fitting into pockets!<\/p>\n<p>A huge perk of the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\/apple-iphone-se\\\">iPhone SE<\/a> is the A13 Bionic chipset acting as the brains of the phone. This component is actually the fastest chipset in a smartphone. You can also find the A13 in the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, showing just how high quality it really is. Thanks to this chip, your child can experience the smoothest uploads and downloads, uninterrupted browsing and even buffer free videos. This chip also works to make sure the battery keeping the iPhone SE stays efficient so you don\u2019t have to worry about a dead phone.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Best Phones for Kids<\/h2>\n<p>When it comes down to really deciding on the best phones for kids, it comes down to what your child needs and what you can afford. If you can\u2019t fork out for the latest technology, then don\u2019t. Children love the novelty of a smartphone and introducing them to modern technology at the top end will just keep up their expectations. You can find plenty of devices that are super budget friendly but have most modern features. Of course, if you can afford something top end and expensive, then there are plenty of options for you to do so.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Whilst these are the best phones for kids in our opinion, there are thousands of other additions you can choose. From huge brands to lesser known manufacturers, there really is something for everyone. You can even find pretty high tech devices at a super affordable price.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>There\u2019s been an ongoing argument as to when children should get their first phone, whatever your opinion, these are the best phones for kids. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":5251,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false,"_genesis_hide_title":false,"_genesis_hide_breadcrumbs":false,"_genesis_hide_singular_image":false,"_genesis_hide_footer_widgets":false,"_genesis_custom_body_class":"","_genesis_custom_post_class":"","_genesis_layout":""},"categories":[5,11,13,21],"tags":[54,74,175,189,218,231,239,347,355],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.3 -
