In the modern world, people go from one place to the next all the time. You can be in France one night, and London the next. It\\&#8217;s not difficult to go abroad anymore, and some people need to for their business. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">Staying in contact with clients is therefore pretty important. You need to be sure that you\\&#8217;ve got a phone which will work when you go abroad. It can be important to know what limitations and restrictions you might face. Today, we\\&#8217;ll be investigating whether a UK phone will function properly in the USA.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Going Abroad &#8211; The Rules<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">From a hardware perspective, you will find that nearly all phones made within the last decade have designs which allow them to work in other countries. With so many people going abroad all the time, it\\&#8217;s become a given that you\\&#8217;ll take your phone to remote and exotic locations. So if you\\&#8217;re worried about that, you don\\&#8217;t have to be.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">However, it\\&#8217;s a different story when you\\&#8217;re looking at the network coverage and your ability to send texts and make phone calls. That\\&#8217;s something which won\\&#8217;t always happen, and it\\&#8217;s essential to understand all the different options you have available, and it all starts with your <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/mobile-phone-deals\\\">contract and data plan<\/a> if you\\&#8217;ve got one.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><b>Data Plans and Contracts<\/b><\/h2>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">One of the most significant considerations which you\\&#8217;ll need to make is whether or not you have a data plan which allows you to make calls and texts in the USA. What you will find is that when you\\&#8217;re abroad, you\\&#8217;ll be on what\\&#8217;s known as an \\&#8217;international plan\\&#8217;. This setup allows your phone to retain it\\&#8217;s network coverage, despite being outside of the country. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">The first thing that you should do is speak to your network provider about the service in the USA. Nearly all have an international option, but it can be expensive. Naturally, you want to avoid increased costs where possible. In some cases, it may well be a cheaper option to acquire a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/best-sim-only-deals\\\">SIM card<\/a> and activate it while you\\&#8217;re abroad, especially if you\\&#8217;re going for a few weeks. Doing so will give you full network coverage from the providers that operate in the area. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">However, there are options for UK customers who have mobile phone contracts. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/network\/ee-mobile-phone-deals\\\">EE<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.fonehouse.co.uk\/network\/vodafone-mobile-phone-deals\\\">Vodafone<\/a> have been known to offer international roaming as part of the agreement as a gift for people who take out a deal with them. It\\&#8217;s worth checking to see if that\\&#8217;s available to you. <\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\\\"font-weight: 400;\\\">In summary, you will find that from a hardware perspective, you can use a UK phone in the USA. All current models and phones made within the last ten years or so are suitable for use abroad. But when it comes to data plans and your network coverage, you may have to do some investigation. If your provider offers signal in other countries, make sure you know about the costs in advance, or seek out a temporary SIM. It\\&#8217;s also essential to see if international roaming charges can be included in your contract as standard too.<\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It\\&#8217;s never been easier to travel.
