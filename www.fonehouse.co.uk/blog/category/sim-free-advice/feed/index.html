<p>SIM free phones are a brilliant choice for those who don’t like being tied to phone contracts, or who like to switch up their phone regularly. If you’re interested in purchasing a SIM-free handset, this easy-to-read guide will help you to make an informed decision.</p>



<h2>What is SIM Free?</h2>



<p>To understand what SIM free is, it’s helpful to first understand what a SIM card is. SIM stands for subscriber identity module, and it’s a computer chip that connects you and identifies you to your network, as well as containing information like your phone number.</p>



<p>A SIM free phone is exactly what it sounds like, it’s a phone that comes without a SIM card.</p>



<p>This means you can purchase your own SIM card separately or even insert a SIM card from your old phone. It also means that you buy your phone upfront rather than through a pay monthly contract.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="731" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Phones-1024x731.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10248" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Phones-150x107.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Phones-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Phones-768x549.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Phones-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Phones-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Phones-2048x1463.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>How Do SIM Free Phones Work?</h2>



<p>With a SIM free handset you simply insert your SIM into your chosen phone. There are then three types of SIM only contract you can opt for. These are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Pay As You Go SIMs</strong>: The data, minutes and texts on these SIM cards are topped up by the user whenever needed. This is a great cost-effective option if you’re someone who doesn’t use their phone much. However, if you, like many of us, use your phone a lot, the below options might be better for you.</li><li><strong>Contract SIMs</strong>: With this option you sign a contract which lasts for an agreed amount of time. During this time, you pay a certain monthly amount of money for a certain monthly amount of data, texts and minutes.</li><li><strong>Pay Monthly SIMs</strong>: Similar to the above option, except your contract rolls over every month. This gives you more freedom as you can cancel your contract 30 days in advance of the next rollover if needed.</li></ul>



<h2>Can You Put Any SIM in a SIM Free Phone?</h2>



<p>Not quite. Firstly, your SIM card must be the appropriate size for your handset. Older phones tend to use mini (standard) size SIMs whilst newer phones generally use micro or nano SIMs.</p>



<p>There are also two types of SIM free phone. Network locked phones are for those who wish to change their handset but not their pay monthly deal as these phones will only work with SIMs from a particular network. On the other hand, unlocked phones will accept SIMs from any network as long as it is the correct size.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="731" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Guide-1024x731.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10249" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Guide-150x107.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Guide-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Guide-768x549.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Guide-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Guide-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Guide-2048x1463.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>Why Buy a SIM Free Phone</h2>



<p>There are several reasons to choose a SIM free handset, such as:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Travel friendly</strong>: If you are someone who travels abroad a lot, a SIM free phone can come in handy. This is because you can switch out your SIM card for one available in the country you are visiting, enabling you to make calls and send texts in that country.</li><li><strong>Cost effective</strong>: Although SIM free phones have a higher up-front cost for the handset itself, many people save money in the long term. Especially because shopping for your phone and contract separately enables you to find the best deal.</li><li><strong>Freedom</strong>: With a SIM free phone, you can choose whichever network provider you like. And you won’t have any locked features or network apps.</li><li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: You can change your phone whenever you like.</li><li><strong>High resale value</strong>: When changing your phone, you can sell your old SIM free phone for a great price thanks to its open compatibility.</li><li><strong>Less stress over credit checks: </strong>If you have a lower than average credit score, buying SIM free is a great option for you as the credit checks can be less rigorous- particularly with a Pay As You Go SIM only contract.</li></ul>

<p><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/best-sim-only-deals">SIM only deals</a> are very popular, and people choose them over a contract for many reasons. First of all, you can save quite a lot of money per month, and it gives you greater flexibility around when you can change your handset. The only downside is, you will have to pay for a handset upfront or use one you already have.</p>



<p>That being said, if you are smart about it, you can gain a lot from switching to a SIM only deal. If you aren’t sure a SIM only deal is the right choice for you, we have a range of other <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals">contract deals</a> you can look at.</p>



<h2>What is a SIM Only Deal?</h2>



<p>A SIM only deal is as simple as it sounds, it means you get a SIM deal with no handset. It can be a great way to get a good deal on data, texts and calls without paying a high contract each month – because you won’t be paying monthly for your device.</p>



<p>Traditionally, SIM only deals were Pay As You Go deals, however now there are Pay As You Go and Pay Monthly SIM only deals to choose from. SIM only pay monthly contracts tend to get you a lot more for your money however – if you are happy to sign up to a contract. These contracts are typically shorter than mobile phone contracts and start at around 12 months.</p>



<h2>How Do SIM Only Deals Work?</h2>



<p>With a SIM only deal you will pay a monthly fee like you do with a handset contract however it will be much cheaper as you don’t pay a handset monthly fee. So, for example our SIM only deals start from £6 per month.</p>



<p>With SIM only deal you get different data, minute and text allowances as you do with a phone contract. So, you need to make sure you are choosing the best one for you and your phone usage.</p>



<h2>How Much Data Will I Need on a SIM Only Deal</h2>



<p>Data is now one of the most important considerations to make when you are purchasing a mobile contract or SIM only deal. If you are someone who uses your phone out of the house a lot, away from Wi-Fi, and uses a lot of social media – you will likely want to consider a higher amount of data such as upwards of 30GB and preferably unlimited.</p>



<p>Even if you are someone who doesn’t use their phone much out of the house, you still want to consider having some data to use maps and other helpful apps.</p>



<h2>Getting the Most out of Your SIM Only Deal</h2>



<p>The best way you can get the most out of your SIM only deal, financially, is if you already own a handset and you don’t worry about having the latest model. On the other hand, you may want to purchase a new phone outright and then get a SIM only deal – this is also a good solution if you have the lump sum to do so.</p>



<p>We wouldn’t recommend a SIM only deal if you like to switch out your handset for the newest model every couple of years, as it can become expensive to pay outright for a new phone every 24 months. If this sounds like you, we would recommend looking at a pay monthly contract instead.</p>



<h2>Can I Use a SIM Only Deal If My Handset is Locked?</h2>



<p>Sometimes phones are locked to their network provider – so, for example your handset may be locked to Vodafone meaning you can only use a Vodafone SIM in it. However, once your previous contract has ended – which it must have done for you to take advantage of a SIM only deal, you can ask your provider to unlock your phone and then you are good to go.</p>



<p>Everyone is different when it comes to mobile phones, and the best deal for one isn’t always the best for another. Therefore, it is important to weight up whether SIM only is the best deal for you. If it is we have <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/best-sim-only-deals">plenty of deals for you to take a look at</a>! If not, have a browse of our equally as fantastic <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals">mobile phone deals</a>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When purchasing a new phone, it can be hard to decide whether to buy SIM free or contract. Both options have fabulous advantages, but each one comes with their share of disadvantages too. To help you figure out whether you want a <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/sim-free-phones">SIM free</a> or contract phone, we’ve laid out the pros and cons of both.</p>
<h2><strong>SIM Free Phones</strong></h2>
<p>A SIM free deal is when you purchase your phone outright without the accompanying SIM card. With this type of deal, you pay the full cost for your phone up front, and shop around for a SIM card/network deal separately.</p>
<p>There a number of SIM free benefits, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>They can be cheaper in the long term, despite the substantial upfront cost.</li>
<li>They’re great for commitment-phobes as <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/best-sim-only-deals">SIM only deals</a> tend to be shorter than pay monthly contract deals.</li>
<li>You can choose whichever service provider you like, enabling you to shop around for the best SIM only network deals.</li>
<li>They are perfect for going abroad as you can swap out your SIM card for one available in the country you are visiting.</li>
<li>You can take total control of your spending through Pay as You Go.</li>
<li>Unlocked phones have higher resale value.</li>
<li>There are no network locked features.</li>
<li>There is no network branding on the phone, leading to a more aesthetically pleasing handset.</li>
<li>You can change your phone whenever you like.</li>
<li>You can change your network provider whenever you like.</li>
<li>They are perfect for going abroad as you can swap out your SIM card for one available in the country you are visiting.</li>
<li>You may not have to go through a meticulous credit check.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are some negatives to SIM free phones, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initial cost can be high as you will be paying the full upfront cost of the phone.</li>
<li>You may miss out on certain network offers, freebies and perks.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Pay Monthly Contract Phones</h2>
<p>A pay monthly contract is when you purchase a phone with a connected SIM that allows you to call, text and use data services for a pre-arranged cost over a duration of time, usually 24 months, To make it more affordable. You buy through a network which the phone is locked to. There are substantial benefits to this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>It allows you to purchase the latest phones in an affordable and budget-friendly manner, as you don’t have to shell out the total cost at once.</li>
<li>You can access network perks like free subscriptions and discount codes.</li>
<li>You can access benefits such as cashback amounts to bring monthly costs down.</li>
<li>Paying in a timely manner can build a good credit score which is handy in situations such as applying for homes.</li>
<li>Some mobile contracts offer unlimited data, great for those always on the go.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, there are a few disadvantages to a pay monthly contract such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>A cancellation fee for switching providers.</li>
<li>High charges for exceeding your monthly allowance of minutes, texts or data.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope we’ve helped make the decision of a SIM free vs contract phone a little easier for you. Whichever you choose, Fonehouse has a range of awesome deals on both <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/sim-free-phones">SIM free</a> and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals">pay monthly</a> contract phones, so you can be sure you’ll find a handset you love.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For a long time, the mobile phone and the SIM card came hand-in-hand. You needed the SIM to be able to get the most from a handset, and you needed the phone itself to contact people. Because of this almost symbiotic relationship, no one challenged the idea that you couldn\&#8217;t buy a phone without buying a SIM to go with it. </span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, times have changed. With mobile phone contracts and deals currently the standard way to use a phone, people have challenged the status quo. So the question for today is simple. Can you buy a mobile phone without a SIM?</span></p>
<h2><b>Why Would You Not Want a SIM?</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With SIM cards being such a standard part of any mobile experience, understanding why you wouldn\&#8217;t suddenly want one is vital. There\&#8217;s a couple of different reasons why you might want a mobile phone without a SIM to go with it. First of all, you might already have a SIM with a mobile number and don\&#8217;t want or need a new one. You fancy getting yourself a new handset though, so that\&#8217;s all you set out to acquire.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Alternatively, you might not need a SIM. The modern smartphone is capable of many things and can serve as a portable tablet or computer for many people. The SIM is sometimes surplus to requirement &#8211; all many people need is an internet connection to go online, check emails, run a business and keep up with friends.</span></p>
<h2><b>What Limitations Exist Without a SIM?</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While you can buy mobile phones without a SIM, you will find that there limitations on what you can and cannot do with your device. Understandably, you won\&#8217;t be able to make or receive calls and text messages. These are things you can only do with a network connection, and you don\&#8217;t have that without a SIM. </span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Furthermore, you won\&#8217;t be able to get any of the various contracts and deals that we offer! Because a handset can be replaced and changed, many people find that the commitment they have is tied directly to the SIM card itself. Without it, you can\&#8217;t access any of the benefits such as free calls, texts or the free perks offered by the network providers. You also cannot turn your phone into a portable wifi hotspot either, because it doesn\&#8217;t have a source of independent data. </span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Overall, you can <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/sim-free-phones\">buy a mobile phone without a SIM</a> to go with it. However, you need to understand that there are pros and cons to this. If you\&#8217;re someone who\&#8217;s going to put a pre-existing SIM into the phone, then you\&#8217;re in luck. However, if you\&#8217;re someone who wants to be able to get access to a free provision of texts and calls, you may find that this isn\&#8217;t possible without a contract. </span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals\">mobile phone deals</a> are tied to the SIM itself. It\&#8217;s vital to assess your needs when you\&#8217;re thinking of buying without a SIM because there are situations where it can be more beneficial to get something with a SIM included. </span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Not everyone has WIFI everywhere they go, and this means you will need a data plan big enough to handle streaming, listening to music or your weekend Netflix binge.</p>
<p>Big data plans generally come with 15GB of data or more and typically Vodafone and EE have the best large data plans in the UK.</p>
<p>If you are happy with your current handset and just want to upgrade your sim to a larger data plan the best way to do this is <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/simonly\">buy a sim only plan</a>.</p>
<p>Below shows some of the best sim only tariffs available on EE and Vodafone to help you not use data outside of your current plan and get a surprise bill!</p>
<p><strong>Our best Large Data Sim Only Plans on EE</strong></p>
<p>You can pick up an EE sim only plan with unlimited minutes and texts, 20GB of data on EE’s essential plan for only £25 per month. This also comes with Apple music free for six months or you can choose BT Sport for free for three months.</p>
<p>If that’s not enough data for you, you can raise the bar to 40GB of data with unlimited minutes and texts with the same BT sport and Apple music addons for only £30 per month.</p>
<p><strong>Our Best Large Data Sim Only Plans on Vodafone</strong></p>
<p>Vodafone have plenty of tariffs to choose from but two tariffs standout of the plans that match data hoggers perfectly.</p>
<p>Get 20GB of data on Vodafone’s Red Extra plan with unlimited minutes and texts and £30 cashback for only £20 per month. That’s a huge amount of data for £20.</p>
<p>If you need a bit more you can buy £30 GB of data on Vodafone’s Red Entertainment including unlimited texts and minutes which comes with Spotify, Now TV or Sky sports mobile.</p>
<p>If you need even more, you can choose Vodafone’s 40GB tariff for only £30 per month. This again comes with Red Entertainment, but you also get £60 cashback making the monthly tariff equivalent to £25 per month.</p>
<p>We offer a wide range of <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/simonly\">sim only plans which can be viewed here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hunting for a SIM free smartphone that delivers great performance at a reasonable price can often be a frustrating task, but it can also often be an attractive option for those of us who wish to pay a low monthly price on a SIM only contract that will last them a long time.</p>
<p>Or maybe you’re looking for an affordable mobile phone deal because your old handset has been lost, stolen or, unfortunately broken. We know what it’s like, these things happen, and there’s only so long that you can go on with a smartphone screen that is so smashed that you can barely read your text messages. You need a new handset, and you need one now.</p>
<p>Luckily here at Fonehouse we have some of the best SIM free deals to enable you plenty of choice when it comes to purchasing a new smartphone. In this handy little blog post we’ve pulled together a selection of our finest smartphones for under £300, but you can check out all of our favourite SIM free deals right here.</p>
<h3><strong>Huawei P Smart</strong></h3>
<p>First on our list of deals is the impressive <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/Huawei-P-smart\">Huawei P Smart</a>. Here at Fonehouse we still feel a little out of sorts calling the P Smart as a ‘budget’ handset because it really does offer the specs of a smartphone of a much higher calibre. It’s a beautifully designed handset and comes in four stunning colour options, giving the feel of a much more premium phone. But we all know it’s not just about looks; the P Smart is a great little piece of technology.</p>
<p>The Huawei P Smart combines a 5.65 inch, 18:9 screen with a 1080&#215;2160 high resolution display and top of the range specifications. The sharp details and vivid colours of the display are extremely impressive and  the ultra responsive fingerprint scanner is an added bonus that is a feature usually reserved for the more expensive handsets on the market.</p>
<p>The P Smart runs on the efficient EMUI 8.0 to give a speedy performance. With 32GB of storage there’s more than enough room for all your favourite photos and apps, and a 3000mAh battery delivers a decent enough performance.</p>
<p>When you add to that a 13MP rear camera with an 8MP front shooter, with both delivering photos of a high quality, this really is a fantastic smartphone for the price.</p>
<p>So how much will the Huawei P Smart set you back? Surprisingly you can get your hands on this great handset for just £229 at Fonehouse, and with our great next day delivery service you could be texting and snapping pictures the very next day!</p>
<h3><strong>Samsung Galaxy A5</strong></h3>
<p>The upgraded <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/Samsung-Galaxy-A5-2017?\">Samsung Galaxy A5</a> is a great option for shoppers who are looking for that reliable Samsung standard of smartphone manufacturing without the price tag that goes along with some of the brands high end smartphones.</p>
<p>Incredibly this smartphone packs a 16MP camera, more high spec than even the S8 or S8+, allowing you to take your photography to the next level and record all of your most important memories in all of their crisp, clear, HD glory.</p>
<p>The A5 is also a really well designed phone, keeping up the high level of intelligent design that we’ve come to know and love from Samsung smartphones. The 5.2 inch Gorilla glass display, and IP68, the A5 make for a durable and reliable handset that can withstand the elements and trials of daily life that won’t let you down. Add to that a huge 3000mAh battery and you know you won’t be caught short on the go with a loss of power.</p>
<p>When you think of Samsung when it comes to SIM free we wouldn’t blame you for assuming that you’re going to have to fork out for an expensive smartphone, however at Fonehouse we want to give you the best brands at the best prices, and that means you can get your hands on the Samsung Galaxy A5 for just £279, giving you an amazing smartphone at a reasonable price.</p>
<h3><strong>Sony Xperia XA2</strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to affordable smartphones we always like to count on our friends at Sony to deliver.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/Sony-Xperia-XA2?\">Sony Xperia XA2</a> is a great value smartphone that combines a 5.2 inch display and is fully equipped with  Corning Gorilla Glass, offering both stunning clarity and reinforced durability.</p>
<p>Although the XA2 is affordable, you don’t have to worry about compromising on great specifications. An astonishing 23MP camera is one of the most powerful you’ll see in a handset of this price, featuring Exmor RS for mobile sensor and 4K video recording for incredible quality in any lighting conditions. On top of that there’s also a great 8MP front facing camera for selfies that will always have you looking your best.</p>
<p>At Fonehouse you can get hold of the Xperia XA2 for just £286, and in our opinion it’s a great option if you’re looking for an affordable handset that won’t let you down.</p>
