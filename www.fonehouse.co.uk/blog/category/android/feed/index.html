										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of everyone’s favourite thing about Apple’s recent releases is the Memoji but how do you make custom emojis on an Android? There is actually a way and it’s worth trying it out.</p>
<p>This feature is something that has recently been bought to <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/os/android-mobile-phone-deals\">Android</a> that allows you to edit two emojis together to create some super cool new emojis. Mixing your favourite emojis is pretty cool and can show some serious emotions in your messages. The exciting addition to Android phones is called Emoji Kitchen. You can’t yet mix all emojis but this is in the works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What do you need?</h2>
<p>As this is a Google app, you can only make use of it if you have an Android phone. Currently, Google is only testing the Emoji Kitchen feature so you do need to <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.inputmethod.latin\">register to become a tester</a> and download the app. The feature is only in testing stages so not every app you have will be compatible with these new emoji creations. Major apps are working with the new add ons, such as Facebook and lots of Google apps. If Emoji Kitchen goes down well with it’s testers, we may see more and more app updates to ensure they are compatible with it.</p>
<p>Once you have registered, you’ll have a list of instructions as to how to get your hands on the app. All you need to do is follow the relevant links and set it all up. You’ll find a link taking you through to the Google Play Store where you can download the Gboard. If you already have the Gboard installed, you will need to update it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How do you create the emoji?</h2>
<p>Now for the fun parts! How do you make customer emojis on an Android? Look no further! We’re about to get into how we actually do this.</p>
<p>All you need to do is open up your Gboard to access these emoji creations. Tap through to the little blue face on right near the space bar. You should see an instruction with ‘tap an emoji to get suggestions’ appear. Simply pick an emoji and all mashups available will appear. Each emoji that is included in the feature will have a list of combinations so make sure you have a good look around!</p>
<p>There are quite a few emojis that aren’t compatible with this mix up as of yet however, Google is bound to extend the range of emojis used. Currently, you can get different combinations from most regular faces however, not too many other than that.</p>
<p>Sending your fun new creation is just like sending any other text. Once you’ve made up your mind on the perfect smiley, click this and it will appear in your text box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You won’t be able to send these versions of emojis through apps that aren’t compatible as of yet. You can have a play around on different apps to find out exactly what apps are compatible but an iPhone will not support this!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have just got your latest and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals\">Samsung Mobile Phone</a>, and now you want to know how to get the best of it. What better than installing some killer apps for it, and these are some of the best that you should download to make the most of your <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus\">S10 Plus.</a></p>
<h2><b>Hidey Hole</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loving the new infinity display, but thinking that the punch holes are ruining it a little, then this is the app for you. This app provides you with a curated list of wallpapers that are designed with the punch holes in mind, and are designed to hide them easily within the design. This means that despite them still being there, you no longer notice them.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This app is constantly updated so you will always find something good to choose from.</span></p>
<h2><b>Holey Light</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things that having an infinity display does is eliminates the notification LED. Which some people are missing as a quick visual indicator as to what is going on. If you are one of those people then this is for you. What the app does is change the colour of the edge of the punch hole camera to pulse with different colours depending on the notifications. This effectively gives you a notification led, but makes use of the punch hole camera to do so.</span></p>
<h2><b>Battery Ring</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is yet another app that does something different with the punch hole in the display for the camera. This time, it lights up partially around the edge as a visual indicator of how much battery life is left on your phone. With tones of customisation options for colours etc, this a great visual indicator of when you need to charge your phone, or when it is done charging on your bedside table.</span></p>
<h2><b>Borderlight</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one isn’t about the punch hole thankfully, but instead what this does is give your entire phone a colourful changing border around your screens edge. Think of it as a more colourful replacement to the edge lighting feature that is found on the phone. This gives a great effect and is in keeping with the current trend in accessories on gaming devices, so maybe this just one for the games in the audience.</span></p>
<h2><b>Sound Assistant</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is unique in that it is an app directly from Samsung, and once installed on your phone it allows you more granular control over how your sound works. It allows you to adjust the sound volume for apps individually as well as change what the volume buttons control, be it media, or call volumes. This is an app that should have been there by default, but as such it is a nice addition.</span></p>
<h2><b>AdHell3</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AdHell3 is one of those useful apps that blocks ads system wide on the phone, it runs as a service in the background, doesn’t require root, and it doesn’t drain your battery, which is fantastic and something that really gives you great control over your phone and saves your data.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s9\">The Galaxy S9’s</a> camera so a leap ahead in terms of the technology. It features a number of innovations, that mean that your photos really pop, and shine in the right light.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Basics</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the S9 you get a single lens, dual aperture rear camera. It is a 12-megapixel wide angle lens and has f/1.5 and f/2.4 variable apertures. This also has an auto-focus lens. It is also capable of capturing video in full 4K UHD at 60 fps, and you also get the super slow-motion video capture mode, this will take video at 960 fps. On the front there is an 8-megapixel camera that is great for taking selfies, and also makes your video calls look really great.</span></p>
<h2><b>Performance</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dual aperture aspect of the lens is designed to improve performance of the camera in low light levels. The selective focus mode uses the dual aperture to bring attention to the object of your picture, whilst blurring out the background. This is a really clever trick, and the dual aperture means that in low light levels you can still get really good results and take great pictures without using the flash.</span></p>
<h2><b>Low Light</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low light has been the focus by Samsung when it came to the camera this time. They wanted to make sure that when you take a photo, that it doesn’t appear washed out or over exposed. Whilst the camera uses automatic settings by default. You can change these manually to ensure that you get the best photo. This includes selecting which aperture to use. You can also switch the phone into Pro mode, and this gives you manual settings for every option. This requires some experimentation, but you can get some great results. The use of HDR also makes sure that the darkest areas of your phone really pops.</span></p>
<h2><b>Photo Software</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of great features included in the camera software, that lets you do many different things. There is an option called AR Emoji, and what this does is use your image to create a number of cartoon animated gifs that you can send to your friends instead of regular emojis. The camera software itself it set up to run everything automatically by default, and this means that most of the time you get the best possible pictures. It includes choosing which aperture to use, and it seamlessly switches between the two depending on the shot. If you find this a little over zealous, then you can use the Pro Mode to override it.</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The camera has been greatly improved on the Galaxy S8 and it is so much better than the one on the Galaxy S8. You can spend hours and hours playing with all the different options and changing the settings, whilst you get a load of really good photos. So, whether you are trying to get into photography, or just want to up your selfie game and become the envy of social media. The options are there for you.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">It is fast approaching that time again when Amazon will be offering their amazing prime day deals, and amongst the offers for inflatable unicorns and discounted bath mats, there will be a huge number of tech deals, and this will include deals on <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals\">mobile phones</a>. Generally, these tend to focus around <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/os/android-mobile-phone-deals\">Android phones</a>, and there have been a few choice deals that have appeared previously, so it is a good idea to keep an eye out.</span></p>
<h2><b>What to Watch For?</b></h2>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">When it comes to prime day, what you need to be aware is that new deals come online all throughout the day, and they only stay available until they are sold out, or an hour passes, whichever is soonest. Prime day starts at midnight on 15</span><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">th&nbsp;</span><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">July this year, but the majority of great deals will appear around peak shopping time, so think the beginning and end of the work day as the best shopping time, along with lunch time. You will need to get in quick if you are going to secure the best deals, so have a look.</span></p>
<h2><b>Finding the Best Prime Day Deal</b></h2>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">One of the ways you can improve your odds of getting a good mobile deal on prime day is took have a look at what deals are going on at the moment. This will also give you time to do a bit of research into the phones as well, and see what you get for your money, and/or whether the deal is worth it. The chances are that a number of the prime day deals will be enhancements of existing deals on mobile phones, so if you find something that looks to be a good deal today, then on prime day it may be even more lucrative. So make sure you know what it is that you are after.</span></p>
<h2><b>Handsets to Look For</b></h2>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">When it comes to the mobile deals on Amazon Prime Day, what you should expect is that it is unlikely to be the latest and greatest, newest handsets that are going to be given the best deals. What you might want to look for is phones where there has recently been a newer model released. The chances are that the older models are going to be the ones that have deals on them as Amazon looks to shift old stock to make way for the newer ones. This is great if you want a deal and you don’t need to have the cutting edge of the market.</span></p>
<h2><strong>B</strong><b>rands to Watch For</b></h2>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">When it comes to mobile deals on Prime Day, you will see some of the biggest and best deals with some of the more independent brands. A couple of Prime Days ago, the ‘WileyFox’ android mobile had an amazing prime day deal, and this was actually one of the best independent Android handsets on the market, and had a very high spec for the price. You are more likely to find deals of this type than on the latest and greatest of the big names.</span></p>
