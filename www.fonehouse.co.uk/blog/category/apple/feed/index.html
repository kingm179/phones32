<p>It’s back!&nbsp; The Fonehouse price promise, is returning this February.&nbsp; A Fonehouse crowd favourite from our last Black Friday sale, and for a limited time we are bringing it back to you.</p>



<p>Throughout February, you can be sure to get the very best deal against 8 of the largest mobile phone retailers and resellers. Including Mobile Phones Direct, Carphone Warehouse, Vodafone Direct, Three Direct, Buymobiles, Affordable Mobiles, ChitterChatter, Mobiles.co.uk.</p>



<p>Meaning you can switch and fix a new deal for yourself this February and save some much-needed cashola. <strong>Take that energy price hikes!</strong></p>



<p>Our <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-offers">February mobile deals and price match</a> are offered across all your favourite devices. Including the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">iPhone 13 range</a>, <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsung S21 range</a> alongside budget and entry level devices starting from just £14 / month.</p>



<p>We are price matching daily, so if you see a great deal today, be sure to take advantage as it may not be there tomorrow!</p>



<p>This offer will only last until the end of February. With deals this low, you’d be mad not to upgrade your mobile now to the latest handset covered under our price match. For further details see our <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-offers">mobile phone offers</a>.</p>



<h3 id="join-our-campaign-this-february-to-switch-and-fix-a-great-deal"><strong>Join our campaign this February, to &#8220;Switch and Fix&#8221; a great deal</strong></h3>



<p>Fonehouse has launched a new campaign to help our customers save money. With the ever-increasing costs from everything to food and energy, isn’t it time to save money on your next mobile contract?</p>



<p>If you are coming out of a contract elsewhere, you might be able to save a bundle by switching to a new network and tariff through Fonehouse. Martin Lewis recently highlighted the savings people can make on their <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2022/01/-martin-lewis--paying-more-than-p10-mth-on-your-phone-bill--if-s/">monthly mobile bills</a>.</p>



<p>You too can save if you opt for a SIM only deal through Fonehouse. Although Martin highlighted how <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/best-sim-only-deals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheap SIM plans</a> can go, you’d also best to think about the real data needs you have with you mobile phone. Opting for a cheap 1GB plan will likely leave you at a loss each month when you run out of data.</p>



<p>Fonehouse offers 50GB, 100GB and Unlimited plans to leave you covered for every type of need you can think of. Starting from just £12/month on Vodafone, with 50GB of monthly refresh data and £45 automatic cashback on top (making the monthly line rental effectively £10.13/month) can save you a bundle if you want to keep your same handset.</p>



<p>Or if you can stretch your budget a bit further you can likely save a whole load of cashola from what you pay now by opting for a new contract with a new device and nothing upfront. Take for example the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-5g">Samsung Galaxy S20 FE with 5G</a>, less than 1 year since launch and you can get a 30GB/month data tariff for just £27/month over 24 months. In the UK, the average monthly tariff is around £37/month so that saves you over £240 across 2 years vs. what people pay on average.</p>



<p>Our team can also help you find a way to save this February. You can call our UK customer service team on 0333 900 1133. We are open until 8pm Monday to Thursday, 6pm Fridays and 5.30pm on Saturdays.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s been an ongoing argument as to when children should get their first phone, whatever your opinion, these are the best phones for kids. Just like when you get your first car, you’re bound to damage your first phone. That’s why a lot of parents prefer to buy something slightly cheaper whilst their kids are learning to deal with phones as they should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy A71</h2>
<p>As a rather new release, the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-a71\">Samsung Galaxy A71</a> brings some of the latest features at a much more affordable price. There are two different variants, one being 5G compatible whilst the other isn’t. We’ve included this in our list for the best phones for kids as it’s extremely affordable for what you get. To keep the phone safe, the display is designed with Corning Gorilla Glass 3. This will make smashing the screen that much less likely. Of course, we would also recommend a screen protector for that extra bit of protection.</p>
<p>This device is also top of the list due to the design. With a plastic back, you don’t have to worry about it smashing. That being said, you also get a pretty attractive finish. With a geometric finish when the light hits, your child is bound to fall in love with this. They’ll also have a choice between Prism Crush Black, Prism Crush Silver, Prism Crush Blue and Prism Crush Pink. Having this many colour options allows them to really add their own style to the device, which is sure to make them look after it even more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Apple iPhone 7</h2>
<p>If you were to ask your child what phone they would like, the most likely answer to come out their mouth will be the newest iPhone. Of course, iPhone’s carry quite the price tag. As new phones are released, old phones drop in price. Released in 2016, the iPhone 7 sits at an extremely affordable price with monthly costs being in the teens. With cashback deals, you can reduce these prices to even lower. Not to mention, with the networks available at Fonehouse, you may even be able to use a few extras for yourself.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-7\">Apple iPhone 7</a>, you get all the most important features in one place. As this phone still has a home button, your child can enjoy fingerprint access to their phone. This makes the phone slightly more exciting as it would be should it only have passcode access. They’ll also get access to iOS, which is one of the friendliest operating systems around. This means that should they be struggling to do something, it’s more than likely that you’ll be able to figure it out for them. There are so many different things your child is going to love, apart from the fact they’ll have an iPhone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Huawei P30 Lite</h2>
<p>Of course, we have to cover off at least one smartphone from each of the top three manufacturers. Huawei produces a huge amount of handsets, all being great for children in their own way. In 2019, we were given the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/huawei-p30-lite\">Huawei P30 Lite</a>, which is one of their lower specification phones. Of course, this also makes it cheaper. With extremely high tech features, you child will love this phone. A huge thing they’ll appreciate is the speeds this phone can give out. When they’re playing games, talking to their friends or watching YouTube videos, they’ll be able to do so without interruptions.</p>
<p>Kids love to express themselves through their smartphones nowadays. A great way of them doing this is by taking photos. Lucky for parents, the Huawei P30 Lite doesn’t only have an amazing price, but also an outstanding camera. On the back of the phone is a triple camera consisting of a 48MP main camera, 8MP ultra wide lens and a 2MP depth sensor. Each of these additions to the camera system will allow them to capture photos in the highest quality with great amounts of detail and life like photos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>iPhone SE</h2>
<p>When we say the iPhone SE is one of the best phones for kids, we mean the up to date one. In 2019, Apple released a new and improved iPhone SE, which holds all the best of the old SE and all the best of modern technology. This is the perfect iPhone for your kids if you’re willing to pay a little more, but not break the bank. Reintroducing a smaller screen means the phone’s far smaller too. With a smaller device, you don’t have to worry about it falling out of pockets or even not fitting into pockets!</p>
<p>A huge perk of the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-se\">iPhone SE</a> is the A13 Bionic chipset acting as the brains of the phone. This component is actually the fastest chipset in a smartphone. You can also find the A13 in the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, showing just how high quality it really is. Thanks to this chip, your child can experience the smoothest uploads and downloads, uninterrupted browsing and even buffer free videos. This chip also works to make sure the battery keeping the iPhone SE stays efficient so you don’t have to worry about a dead phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Best Phones for Kids</h2>
<p>When it comes down to really deciding on the best phones for kids, it comes down to what your child needs and what you can afford. If you can’t fork out for the latest technology, then don’t. Children love the novelty of a smartphone and introducing them to modern technology at the top end will just keep up their expectations. You can find plenty of devices that are super budget friendly but have most modern features. Of course, if you can afford something top end and expensive, then there are plenty of options for you to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst these are the best phones for kids in our opinion, there are thousands of other additions you can choose. From huge brands to lesser known manufacturers, there really is something for everyone. You can even find pretty high tech devices at a super affordable price.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-11-pro">new iPhone 11 Pro</a> hits the shelves users are starting to discover the cool features and tricks. To save you time we have put together a series of blogs that will help you customise your new phone and make it do all the things you ever wanted &#8211; except make the tea, but we are sure that will be coming soon!</p>
<h2><b>Remaining Battery </b></h2>
<p>Knowing how much battery your handset has left is always useful, especially when you are out and about for the day. The good thing with the iPhone 11 Pro is that the battery life is fantastic. When they released the iPhone XS last year the battery life was much extended and seriously impressive.</p>
<p>This time Apple has managed to make even more progress and added an average of 4 hours to the battery time of the XS. So, it really should last you all day even when you are out and about. You will be used to the battery indicator along the top of the screen, and this shows an approximate amount of battery remaining, but until you plug it into the charger or set it down on a wireless charger, you can never be sure exactly how much is left.</p>
<h2><b>Showing the Percentage</b></h2>
<p>Now, if you are out and about, then you won’t always have a charger with you and might wonder just what is going on with the health of the battery. The good news is in one move you can check what percentage of battery the phone is on. The information is located in the control centre, and if you are not familiar, this is a great screen that has lots of useful settings available in a single swipe. If you swipe down in a diagonal direction from the top right-hand corner of the screen, you will see that the battery symbol still appears at the top and now next to it the percentage remaining will be shown.</p>
<h2><b>Low Power Mode</b></h2>
<p>There is one other small adjustment you can make to your control centre that will also help in managing the battery. To set this up for the first time you will need to head into your settings app and from here choose control centre. Here you will see the shortcuts already set up and a list of others you can add.</p>
<p>Scroll down until you find low power mode and hit the green plus sign to add it. Head back to the main screen and swipe down to open the control centre. You will see the new icon, and when you click this on the handset goes into low power mode conserving as much power as possible. The battery along the top will go yellow to show you are in low power mode. Once you are back to a charger simply access the control centre again and toggle low power mode to off. To close the control centre swipe up from the white bar shown at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Shop the full range of <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">iPhone mobile deals</a> online with Fonehouse now.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The iPhone 8 was the last of the iPhones to feature the iconic middle button and was also the first series to bring you wireless charging, so we are not surprised it is still one of the most popular choices when it comes to bagging a new phone.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-8\">iPhone 8</a> was the last of the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals\">iPhones</a> to feature the iconic middle button and was also the first series to bring you wireless charging, so we are not surprised it is still one of the most popular choices when it comes to bagging a new phone. Here are some great tips and tricks for getting the best out of your iPhone 8.</span></p>
<h2><b>Single-Handed Operation </b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find yourself using your phone with one hand, but struggling to reach the whole keyboard without having to overstretch or reach for the other hand, then this is a really nifty tip. You can move the keyboard over to one side or the other, depending on which hand you are using, and it suddenly becomes a piece of cake to single-handedly operate your handset. To set the keyboard press and hold the emoji icon button and you will see three options appear, centre, left or right. Just choose the one you prefer and off you go!</span></p>
<h2><b>Wireless Charging</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we already mentioned, this is a phone with wireless charging capabilities. As yet manufacturers do not give away wireless chargers with handsets, you will still get the lightning cable in the box. The cable tends to charge slightly faster anyway but do have a play with the wireless charging if you get the chance. Any QI compatible charger will work, and when this article was written, Apple had not got around to releasing their own. Of course, there is also wireless charging furniture available in certain stores now, IKEA being one of the leading lights. You can get chargers that resemble stands so you can see the screen easily or flat pads for popping on the side. </span></p>
<h2><b>Discover AR</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Augmented reality is a newer offering from Apple, and it is loads of fun. Thankfully the iPhone 8 has been optimised and comes equipped with the hardware needed, in the form of the A11 Bionic chip. You will find that there are some Apple apps, like the tape measure, and plenty of other cool apps in the App Store, that you can use here. IKEA (at the forefront once again) has cool AR apps, and for younger kids, Thomas the Tank Engine and friends can make an appearance in the room. Many games now feature AR modes, so there really is plenty to do. Gone are the days of Pokemon Go being the only augmented reality game out there. It is spreading like wildfire. </span></p>
<h2><b>Prepare for an Emergency </b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this might sound a little depressing, it is a good thing to do. The iPhone 8 comes with both medical information and emergency SOS. Set up your medical data, which gives you peace of mind that vital information can be passed on if needed and get emergency SOS working. Go to your settings and switch on the feature. Now when you tap the home button five times in a row, the emergency contacts can be called, but the rest of your phone is protected and locked away.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1><strong>Best iPhone Xr Black Friday Deals</strong></h1>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There is nothing quite like the media frenzy that surrounds an Apple product launch. It is always a global event, and people are literally on the edge of their seats to see what is being released. This is an effect that Apple has earned with over a decade of cutting-edge technology and innovation crammed into every new iPhone that they release. This year saw three handsets showcased and as usual, fans were not left disappointed. We have worked hard to bring you the best Black Friday Deals on all three handsets so <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-xr\">let’s take a look at the iPhone Xr and what it can offer. </a></span></p>
<h3><b>iPhone Xr Black Friday Deal 1</b></h3>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The iPhone XR is a special handset that brings a myriad of features to the table. In Apple’s own words this phone was designed to bring their technology to a wider audience by offering a lower price tag on a cut-down handset similar to the premise behind the iPhone SE. What has actually happened is that the feature set has remained impressively high and this has become a seriously in demand handset that will appeal to a mass of users for loads of reasons, such is the versatility.  You could own the iPhone Xr for just £47 a month, with 4GB of data and no upfront cost with a delightful cashback of £120. <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-xr\">Click here to buy the deal.</a></span></p>
<h3><b>iPhone Xr Black Friday Deal 2</b></h3>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The handset features an LCD Liquid Retina display screen which is a cut down from the OLED screen used on the Xs series; however, it is still a stunning display that offers a fantastic graphics performance. With that in mind, this handset is proving popular with gamers as the combined AR technology is giving these three new handsets a real gaming edge. The price tag of the iPhone Xr is so impressive that it is proving to be a handset that customers cannot get enough of. If you would like to get your hands on an iPhone Xr then why not try another deal, this time for £48 a month with a whopping 50GB of data and no upfront cost. <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-xr\">Click here to buy the deal.</a></span></p>
<h3><b>iPhone Xr Black Friday Deal 3</b></h3>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another great design feature of the iPhone Xr is the processing power. Apple has chosen to keep their new processor in this handset. The A12 Bionic is such a powerful chip it brings an already impressive performance to the higher spec Xs handsets. So, you can imagine that sited within the iPhone Xr which has the LED screen and single camera arrangement that the power is going to go even further. </span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are looking for a super fast smartphone that can handle multiple processes at the same time, then you are going to love the speed of this offering. The iPhone Xr also comes in a range of colours which again, is not something Apple often does. It was the iPhone 5c series that last got a colour splash. The iPhone Xr comes in 8 colours including red and coral. So have a look at another great deal for just £49 a month with 25GB of data and no upfront cost. This deal comes with £216 cash back. <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-xr\">Click here to buy the deal.</a></span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are looking for a new mobile phone pay monthly contract then you might want to wait for <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/Paymonthly\">Black Friday deals</a>. Black Friday falls the day after Thanksgiving, and Thanksgiving is the fourth Thursday in November. While this is not really a significant event in the UK the Black Friday sales have captured the imagination of shoppers and retailers alike.</p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>This year Black Friday will fall on November the 23rd, and although we cannot show you the exciting deals just yet, we can have a look at some of the handsets that might just be making an appearance.</p>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy S9</h3>
<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now the second in line in the Samsung fold, it stands to reason that this handset could be the subject of many great Black Friday deals. When the newer Galaxy Note 9 was released there were plenty of deals to be had on this powerful, infinity screen mobile. Packed with awesome technology we know that <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/Handset/Samsung-Galaxy-S9\">users of the Galaxy S9 love their handset</a> so why not join them?</p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>The Samsung Galaxy S9 features biometrics in the form of facial recognition, a dual rear camera set up and all of the customisability we have come to love from this manufacturer. The S9 comes in a range of great colours which adds to the appeal and there are plenty of great contract deals available at no upfront cost which makes this an awesome choice. If you prefer the larger handsets then do check out the deals on the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus which has all the great features in a larger shell.</p>
<h3>iPhone X</h3>
<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is common that when flagship phones get replaced they step back into second place and a range of new and budget busting deals opens up. So, the iPhone X is another great offering that is perfect for Apple fans.</p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>This was the first infinity screen phone released by giants Apple, and the handset offers wireless charging and enhanced biometric security. The A11 Bionic chip brings power and speed to a feature packed phone. With a range of deals for all data allowances available from both Vodafone and EE this is a great Black Friday candidate. <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/Handset/iPhone-X-64GB\">The iPhone X has been widely lauded as a significant leap forward for Apple</a> and a departure from their now iconic bezel style screen seen on many of their earlier models.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We all know how hard it can be to stay on top of our finances every month; one minute we’re over the moon because its payday and we’ve finally reaped the reward for all of our hard work, the next we’re hopelessly trying to figure just where all of that hard earned money has gone to.</p>
<p>If you’ve decided to get a hold on just what your financial position is, take control and make some big savings, then you’ll be happy to learn that we’re about to make it that bit easier for you and all you need is your smartphone.</p>
<p>First things first &#8211; make sure that you’re the responsible owner of a smartphone that isn’t going to drain your bank every month. That doesn’t mean you have to go for a cheap model that doesn’t do much beyond making calls and sending texts. You can still get your hands on a great high-end smartphone for an affordable monthly price.</p>
<p>For example, did you know that at Fonehouse you could order the <u><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/iPhone-7-32GB?\">Apple iPhone 7</a></u> for just £36 per month, with nothing to pay upfront and 20GB of data? So it’s not the most recent release from Apple, but it is still a great smartphone with some ultra-high-end features and is a fabulous choice for anyone who is looking to get their hands on an iPhone minus the hefty price tag. Plus with one of Fonehouse’s great cashback offers you could save even more money off of your bill; see, you’re already making significant savings and we haven’t even got started yet!</p>
<p>While it\&#8217;s always handy that the iPhones come equipped with the handy Apple Pay feature, it can sometimes be a little too convenient, and you may find yourself tapping your phone left, right and centre to pay for things so that before you know it your bank account is seriously struggling. Our first piece of advice to avoid getting into this situation would be to be extremely responsible with Apple Pay; its such a convenient app, but if you’re looking to save make sure you only use it when absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>There are some brilliant apps out there to help aid you with your saving goals. Most banks nowadays have a mobile banking app so that you can constantly keep an eye on your money. We’d also recommend finding out exactly where you stand when it comes to your credit score. The <u><a href="https://www.clearscore.com/blog/introducing-the-brand-new-clearscore-app\">Clear Score app </a></u>is a great app that you don’t have to pay for that will let you know exactly what your score is and how it is changing each month. You can get handy tips on how to improve your score and we guarantee that as soon as you start to see it improve you’ll be feeling much more motivated.</p>
<p>One way of seriously improving your financial situation is through good budgeting, and there are loads of budgeting apps out there for you to access on the  iPhone 7. One of our preferred apps is <u><a href="https://emma-app.com/\">Emma,</a></u> which is widely known as the UK alternative to Mint, and has lots of fans who are willing to testify as to just how useful it is. Emma will link up with your debit or credit cards and align them with a budget that you have tailored yourself. It will let you know if you’re going over budget, and you can make tweaks whenever you want to.</p>
<p>you’ve got your credit score on the up and have your budget all laid out, make sure that you have a banking app that really works for you. You’ve probably heard of <u><a href="https://monzo.com/\">Monzo</a></u> by now as the company have over 60,000 customers and have received a lot of hype in recent months. Monzo is a bank that exists purely on your smartphone and all you have to do is download the app and register for an account. It\&#8217;s all completely free and there are no charges for use within the UK. The app will record every single transaction instantly and even alert you when you pay for something so that you know exactly how healthy your account is.</p>
<p>Check out the <u><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/iPhone-7-32GB?\">iPhone 7 today at Fonehouse</a></u>. We have some great data deals so that you don’t need to worry about paying for extra, all for a low monthly price and no upfront fee. We don’t even charge for our next day delivery service!
