<p><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/google-mobile-phone-deals">Google</a> are known for producing high-performing handsets which are full of speed, power and intelligent photography ability, and with their highly anticipated <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/google-pixel-6a-5g">Google Pixel 6a 5G</a> model going live for preorder on the 21st of July, the Pixel family is finally growing. Here is all the magic this 5G handset has to offer:</p>



<h2>Google Pixel 6a: All Day Power</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10572" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-150x84.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-300x169.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-768x432.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One of the worst things that can happen to any modern-day smartphone user is their phone inconveniently dying midway through the day, with not a charger in sight…. (a complete horror story we know). Well with the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/google-pixel-6a-5g">Google Pixel 6a’s</a> 4410 mAh long-lasting battery this won&#8217;t ever be an issue. Users are supplied with much-needed all-day power (24 hours+) and with the Extreme Battery Saver mode turned on, can even extend their battery life for up to 72 hours total. When you do in fact have to plug in and charge your device, this experience will be quick thanks to fast wired 18W charging. This is a smartphone that wants you to get up and go!</p>



<h2>Google Pixel 6a Design &amp; Display</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10571" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-150x84.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-300x169.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-768x432.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Looks aren’t everything but the design of the Google Pixel 6a 5G is pretty impressive. With 3 different colours up for grabs: Sage, Chalk and Charcoal, paired with a beautifully sleek exterior with rounded edges, no matter what colour option people go for they will be wowed. Also, the large 6.1” FHD+ OLED display featured on the device only adds to the premium aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Google Pixel 6a Camera</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10583" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-150x84.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Lights, camera, action. It’s time for the juicy details about the camera included on this flagship handset. The rear of this device features a dual-lens set-up, consisting of a 12.2MP wide lens and a 12MP ultrawide lens. These lenses and added features like Face Unblur work effortlessly together to give users stable and blur-free shots. Magic Eraser gives users the ability to remove unwanted objects from images, and Real Tone captures the authenticity of all skin tones! All these cool features mentioned are Pixel Exclusives, so they’re completely one of a kind. Side note the selfie camera on this device is 8MP so it’s also great at giving you picture-perfect photos.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Google Pixel 6a: Protection &amp; Privacy</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-protection1-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10578" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-protection1-150x84.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-protection1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-protection1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-protection1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-protection1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-protection1-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/sony-xperia-10-iv-5g-128gb-black">Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G</a> has been labelled as the “perfect companion for everyday life”. You might be wondering what exactly does that mean? Well, in this new handsets case, this means a long-lasting 5,000mAh battery great for long days of adventure, a 6.0” illuminating OLED display destined for streaming perfection, High-Resolution Audio for a concert-like listening experience and so much more. I put these claims to the test by taking this shiny new handset with me on a London day out (a very long one at that). Will this lightweight <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/sony-mobile-phone-deals">Sony</a> handset live up to the hype? Keep scrolling to find out.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1: 6.0” 21:9 Wide OLED Display&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>We all want a display that injects life into everything we do on our devices, whether that’s endless social media scrolling, streaming your favourite guilty pleasure TV show or even engaging in some quality gaming time. The 6.0” Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G display has a lot of cool features under its belt. To name a few a 21:9 FHD+ OLED TRILUMINOS Display for breathtaking colour and contrast and a 2520 x 1080 resolution for crystal clear visuals.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1:  Display Test </strong></h2>



<p>If you’re a film fanatic you’re probably used to heading to the likes of Youtube to check out the latest trailers that are fresh on the scene and to test the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G display I did just that. This time I watched the Woman Is King Trailer- a highly anticipated film due to be released in October 2022.</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1: Result&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10542" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As soon as I hit play I was blown away by the magic the TRILUMINOS® display the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G had to offer. The truest golds, deepest greens and boldest purples were showcased and the large 6”0 screen size only added to the experience further. There is a reason why Sony are known for their expertise in remarkable displays. The handset also fitted comfortably in hand due to its compact design and super lightweight feel.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Triple Lens Rear Camera&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>An exceptional camera is a requirement for the majority of modern-day smartphone users (I mean how else will we snap all of our wonderful Instagram content?). This Sony device&#8217;s triple rear camera has been described as “feature-packed” and “breathtaking”. This camera set-up consists of a 16mm 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, a 27mm 12MP wide-angle lens and lastly a 54mm 8MP telephoto lens.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Camera Test</strong></h2>



<p>Since I spent the weekend exploring all the magic London has to offer from views to food, I thought this was the perfect opportunity to use the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G to capture it in all its glory.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Result</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gDJuObLpaV_9irrw2Do6nLAri7C2dHJqcEnwM5moUuC_2qDPq6ZrTME2VDvCdI1rlMy_ninlHb9yscbq_qtO_5uGZLxvzXkKxDwIdBa3K__eS-txTbKyeHxYmFl4814DZ0M9EkgLybUxSpw_iBXlwew" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Brick Lane in East London was my first stop, where I was hit with a beautiful range of colourful street art and graffiti which I just had to snap some photos of. The Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G effortlessly picked up all the vibrancy and light within the shot thanks to the trio of lenses and incredible LED flash. If posting art across your social media platforms is your thing, this is the perfect camera for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My second stop with the Sony Xperia by my side was the South African restaurant Shaka Zulu in Camden Market. Thanks to Optical Image Stabilisation, Night Mode and Auto HDR, my photos were blur-free, stable and clear despite the restaurant&#8217;s very low lighting conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the beautiful colours of the dishes were picked up at exceptional quality, and again the incredible LED flash illuminated the shot efficiently. A photo so good you can almost taste it. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10537" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-150x113.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1.jpg 1249w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2><strong>Feature 3: Powerful 5,000mAh Battery For All Day Power&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>A long-lasting battery is essential for any long day out, I mean there’s music to be played, photos to be taken and videos to be streamed. Thankfully the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G is equipt with a large capacity 5,000mAh battery giving users much-needed ‘all-day power’.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3: Battery Test </strong></h2>



<p>Leaving my house at 11 AM with the Sony handset by my side, and not getting back home until 11 PM that night, gave this handset a solid 12 hours test to see if the claim of ‘all-day power’ had some proof behind it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3: Result</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="447" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-1024x447.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10544" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-150x65.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-300x131.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-768x335.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-1024x447.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-1536x670.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-2048x894.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Starting on a 100% charge and after 12 hours of photo-taking, bursts of gaming and music-playing, the Xperia device&#8217;s 5,000mAh battery only dropped by 12% &#8211; not bad at all for a full day&#8217;s work. Life with this smartphone means using a power bank won&#8217;t be a regular occurrence at all. Looks like the ‘All Day Power’ statement has proof in the pudding after all.</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 4: Premium Sound&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Sony and premium sound come hand in hand. For a truly authentic listening experience, the 10 IV 5G is equipt with High-Resolution Audio (which gives you premium sound), 360 Reality Audio Upmix (which works with local audio files and streaming services to further enhance your listening experience) and a 3.5mm audio jack (perfect for on the go streaming).&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 4:  Sound Test </strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" data-id="10543"  src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10543" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-80x80.jpg 80w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</figure>



<p>As a music lover, I was excited to test out the audio quality on this device. The golden question was would the experience be mini-concert worthy and premium? To answer this burning question I headed to Spotify, pressed a feel-good song and listened away.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 4: Result</strong></h2>



<p>The audio quality from this handset was one of a kind. The 360 Reality Upmix feature in particular created an immersive experience in real-time. Achieving premium quality sound on this device is done with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately I found the 10 IV 5G very impressive. Not only were the acclaimed stand-out features regarding the display, camera, sound and battery true, but they actually exceeded my expectations. </p>



<p>After hearing all the wonderful things the<a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/sony-xperia-10-iv-5g-128gb-black"> Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G</a> has to offer I&#8217;m sure you’re eager to get your hands on a device of your own.

<h2>Tip 1: How To Switch On Quick Launch Camera Button<strong> </strong></h2>

To do this head to: <strong>Settings &gt; Advanced Features &gt;Side Key&gt; Enable quick Launch Camera</strong> Option <strong>(sidenote: make sure the Double Press toggle is switched on). </strong>The days of fumbling around trying to launch your camera are over.&nbsp;</p>

With each option you select a slider will appear at the bottom allowing you to adjust exactly how warm or cool you want your display to be. If this isn&#8217;t slider isn&#8217;t enough detail for you don&#8217;t worry, all you have to do is press the <strong>Advanced Settings </strong>button at the bottom of the screen, and RGB sliders will appear allowing you to fine-tune your display even more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Tip 3: How To Turn On Video Enhancer </h2>

We’ve selected three stand-out features of the handset, put them to the test, recorded the result and even added a top tip in there as a bonus. Your decision on whether to take the plunge and get this new HONOR handset made easy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1: First-Time Combination First-Class Display</strong></h2>



<p>There’s a lot of hype surrounding the HONOR Magic4 Pro 6.81” 120Hz adaptive LTPO OLED display. Some phrases that have been thrown out there to describe it are: “truly immersive” “exclusive” and “first-class”. On paper this display seems pretty cool, I mean it&#8217;s quad-curved designed, has a DCI-P3 wide colour gamut and is IMAX ENHANCED certified. Hmm seems pretty impressive right?</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1 Test: </strong></h2>



<p>What’s the one thing we pretty much all do on our devices? Stream entertainment content of course! I headed to the likes of Youtube and Netflix to see if the HONOR Magic4 Pro display really brings visuals to life or not.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1 Result:</strong></h2>

<p>My first stop was Youtube to check out the trailer for the new Avatar: The Way of Water film due to be released later this year. The first thing I noticed was how beautifully in-depth the colours were on the screen. The deepest blues, browns and greens were featured paired with an impressive crystal clear quality. From this test, it’s obvious that the DCI-P3 wide colour gamut and IMAX enhanced certification features are paying off. This experience was like a mini-cinema in the palm of my hand. The “truly immersive” statement is true after all.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1 Tip:</strong></h2>



<p>With a screen as flawless as this, you need to make the most of all things entertainment. So my top tip would be to watch a big blockbuster on the handset! The quad-curved design in particular really does elevate the typical viewing experience so you’ll be in for a treat.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Ultra Fusion Photography</strong></h2>



<p>The advanced camera system behind the HONOR Magic4 Pro has been noted to be one of the handset&#8217;s top stand-out features. With this triple-lens setup (consisting of a 50MP wide lens, a 50MP ultra-wide lens and a 64MP Periscope Telephoto lens), users can effortlessly capture what they see, enjoy HDR photography due to a superior lens, and even enjoy a spectacular night mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2 Test:</strong></h2>



<p>I was curious to see if the HONOR Magic4 Pro camera was all it was made up to be, so I did the logical thing and explored the great outside with it (and by outside I mean I went for a fancy breakfast and snapped some pics of my food). Were the photos remarkably perfect and most importantly Instagram worthy? Well, keep scrolling to find out.</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2 Result:</strong></h2>

<p>I was impressed with the HONOR Magic4 Pro’s photography power. Not only were all the beautiful fine details picked up thanks to the ‘Advanced 7P Wide Camera’, but my shots were completely stable every time thanks to the handsets Flicker Sensor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10394" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-150x113.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Aside from snapping photos of food as you can see from above, I did capture some photos of sceneries too. Again this HONOR device pulled through with its HDR photography and 122° field of view on the Ultra Wide Angle lens, to give me incredible high-quality photos. In my book, this camera is definitely Instagram approved.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2 Tip:&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>In regards to this feature, my top tip is to actually get up and leave your house for once! The HONOR Magic4 Pro camera is simply too good to be sitting inside all day. Get up, explore and take wonderful photos along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3 GPU Turbo X: </strong></h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s start off with the basics, what actually is GPU Turbo X? GPU Turbo X uses AI rendering which enables your smartphone to keep high-quality visuals on-screen whilst lowering energy consumption at the same time. Included frame rate boosting technology paired with this consumption adjustment factor also enhances battery life and ultimately aims to improve the overall gaming experience. It’s time to put this cool feature to the test.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3 Test:</strong></h2>



<p>Okay so the method I took for this test is pretty obvious, I headed to the Google Play Store and downloaded a game -big shock I know. The particular game, I trialed out was ‘Race Master 3D- Car Racing’ for the lengthy duration of two hours.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3 Result:</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10404" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The effects of the GPU Turbo X feature were clearly evident to me. Despite gaming for a solid two hours straight the battery life on the HONOR Magic4 Pro remained consistently high, and the graphics were continually top-quality. Compared to gaming on other handsets, I found gaming on this device more hands-on, and the experience as a whole was more immersive and addictive (hence gaming for two hours straight). So if you’re a gaming fanatic out there you’re in luck, this HONOR handset is bound to elevate your experience to levels you’ve never reached before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3 Tip:</strong></h2>



<p>Maybe you’re an avid gamer and you already know all the hit games, but if you’re not I suggest you do some research on what’s popular right now in the world of Andriod gaming. Find a pick and try it out for yourself on the HONOR Magic4 Pro. See for yourself if it&#8217;s worth all the hype (big spoiler: it most definitely is).&nbsp;</p>





<p>After reading all the ins and outs regarding the features the HONOR Magic4 Pro has to offer from its beautiful large display to its remarkable photography power, I&#8217;m sure you’ll want to find the best money-saving deal too right? Well look no further Fonehouse has a bunch of <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/honor-magic4-pro-5g">fantastic deals</a> on this handset up for grabs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The new <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/sony-xperia-1-III-5G">Sony Xperia 1 mark III</a> is being hailed as Sony’s best handset yet – and we would have to agree. The Xperia 1 III is Sony’s new flagship smartphone and offers one of the best displays, impeccable battery life and an impressive camera that is easy to use.</p>
<p>Sony revealed their new flagship phone back in April 2021 – but it is only now being released, so we have had a good 4 months to get ready for this exciting launch and we can’t wait for you to get your hands on it.</p>
<h2><strong>Design </strong></h2>
<p>The design of the latest Xperia 1 III model is not dissimilar to previous models in the range. It features the same long and narrow design as its predecessors – this time with a 6.5 inch 21:9 aspect ratio display. The design makes this handset much longer than its rival handsets such as the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-5g">Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra</a>.</p>
<p>This time around, the Sony handset is a little thicker than the Xperia 1 II – this is purely to make room for the large battery and don’t worry you won’t even notice the difference in size!</p>
<p>Something worth noting is that this phone features front-facing stereo speakers, the same as previous models, but in this case, they are 30% louder so if you are looking for a phone that does your music justice – this could be the one.</p>
<h2><strong>Display </strong></h2>
<p>Sony Xperia handsets are the only ones to feature 4K resolution so you can always be sure you’re getting a stunning display. This time, Sony have opted for a 120Hz refresh rate – so the Xperia 1 III is at the top of the game. Making playing games, watching videos and streaming content much easier.</p>

<h2><strong>Camera</strong></h2>
<p>It might not seem like much has been updated at first glace however there are some serious improvements to the camera on the Xperia 1 III. Not only does the 12MP 24mm main camera improve the image quality but the optical image stabilisation keeps pictures steady – great for anyone with a shaky hand. Not only that but the ultra-wide camera lets you take a range of shots – with a variable telephoto camera which can actually switch between focal lengths.</p>
<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>
<p>This device has a massive 256GB of storage so you can keep all of your perfectly shot images and videos as well as all your apps. Not only that, but one of the most impressive things about this new handset is the battery life. Compared to the Xperia 1 II there is a significant improvement in battery life – so even with all the great features of this phone it should last all day (and beyond).</p>
<h2><strong>Deals at Fonehouse</strong></h2>
<p>You all know by now, we love a good deal at Fonehouse. So, when you purchase a Sony Xperia 1 III from 19<sup>th</sup> August you will receive a free pair of Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones. All you need to do is purchase the handset or a qualifying contract and you will receive your headphones with your device.</p>

<p>With the release of the new Samsung flagship, we’ve got some of the best Samsung Galaxy S21 5G deals available RIGHT NOW! From low prices to high data packages, there really is something for everyone. Working with the top networks in the UK means we can bring you the very best mobile phone contracts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>About the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G</h2>
<p>You may notice just how smooth the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G screen really is. This is down to the 120Hz refresh rate. Over the last year or so, we’ve seen a number of new features hitting the market. One that was introduced last year with the highest specification device. This year, Samsung have introduced the 120Hz refresh rate to all of their variants. This not only makes the images and text smoother on the screen, but it also allows for a far more responsive screen too. When you swipe between screens or even open up an app, it will happen so much faster than predecessors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something that users get excited about every single year is the camera. On the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G, you can find a triple lens camera. In this is a 12MP wide lens, a 64MP telephoto lens and a 12MP ultra wide lens. Each of these additions will allow you to capture photos from different angles and in different styles. You’ll also be able to enjoy high resolution, detailed images from each addition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>EE Prices&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Every single customer that joins the EE network will also have access to EE entertainment. Through this, you can enjoy a number of different 3-6 month free trial subscriptions. In this plan, you can enjoy names such as Apple Music and BT Sports. It’s an amazing addition to a mobile phone contract, giving users the ability to discover new brands and save money. Once the trial periods have come to an end, you will be able to either continue at a monthly cost or cancel the subscriptions. The best thing about this perk is that you can enjoy every single trial subscription available.</p>
<p>Whilst EE have plenty of benefits that add huge value to a mobile phone contract, they have also won a huge amount of awards. In fact, for 7 years running, EE have been voted the UKs No 1 network. This goes to show that EE can offer high quality experiences whilst keeping this up. They even provide the fastest network speeds and the best network coverage in the UK. All customers on EE will be able to enjoy this amazing perk of the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Three Deals</h2>
<p>There are two different perks you can enjoy when joining Three. One that all users can make use of is Go Roam. Using this, you’ll be able to travel to a range of destinations in the EU, Australia and the USA without incurring nasty roaming charges. Instead, you can use your monthly allowance for free. If you join Three with over 12GB of data in your contract, you can enjoy their Go Binge perk. With this, you can use certain apps, such as Snapchat and SoundCloud, without eating away at your data. All you need is a small amount of data to get started and you’ll be good to go.</p>
<p>Three are known for their huge data packages and this is something they’re keeping up with our Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus 5G deals. By giving customers access to larger data packages for lower monthly costs, we can help you save money. There’s no need to pay for data bolt ons each month or experience the nasty costs of going over your monthly limit. Instead, enjoy a high data plan and make sure these are experiences you don’t come across.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Vodafone Packages</h2>
<p>A huge perk of joining the Vodafone network is their VeryMe Rewards. This is a small section of the Vodafone app that gives its users access to hundreds of different discounts. You can find discount codes giving you money off huge brands that you already love or even find a few new companies you may have never used before. Every now and then, you can even find codes to get free items, such as coffee or even small products. This is something that adds huge amounts of value to each Vodafone contract.</p>
<p>When you join Vodafone with a Red Entertainment plan, you’ll get the chance to enjoy a 24 month free subscription. This is only offered if you are on a Red Entertainment plan and can really build the value of your contract. These customers will be able to activate contracts with brands such as Spotify or Sky Sports. Once the 24 month contract comes to an end, they will be given the chance to either cancel or continue the subscription at a monthly cost.</p>
