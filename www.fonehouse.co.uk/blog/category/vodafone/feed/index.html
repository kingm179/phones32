<h3><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/vodafone-mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-pro-max-5g"><strong>iPhone 13 Pro Max</strong></a></h3>



<p>One of the most powerful phones on the market with the <strong>A15 bionic chip</strong>, the iPhone 13 Pro Max is one of the most desirable handsets available right now. The <strong>pro camera system</strong> comes with telephoto, wide and ultra-wide lenses, not to mention the 12MP <strong>True Depth front camera</strong>. You can also switch your cameras to <strong>cinematic mode</strong> for video recording which gives you shallow depth of field and automatic focus shifting.</p>



<p>Another amazing benefit of the iPhone 13 Pro Max is it’s MagSafe <strong>wireless charging</strong> capabilities. Plus, it has IP86 <strong>water resistance</strong>, perfect for those prone to spills.</p>

<p>Keen photographers will love the Samsung Galaxy A12’s <strong>quad camera</strong>. Audiophiles, on the other hand, will adore the <strong>loudspeaker</strong> and <strong>headphone jack</strong>.</p>

<p>An ideal handset for the clumsy, the Sony Xperia 5 III is protected with <strong>Gorilla Glass 6</strong> at both the front and rear. This phone is also great for <strong>eye health</strong>, as you can adjust the white balance to reduce straining. Gamers will love the Sony Xperia 5 III too, thanks to the <strong>low gamma raiser</strong> which makes dark areas easier to see.</p>



<p>You can take some fantastic photos with the <strong>triple lens camera</strong>&#8211; and there’s no need to worry about taking too many, as the Sony Xperia 5 III boasts up to <strong>256 GB of storage</strong>.</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/vodafone-mobile-phone-deals/xiaomi-12-pro-5g">Xiaomi 12 Pro 5G</a></h3>



<p>The Xiaomi 12 Pro 5G has arguably one of the best screens of any handset on the market. With a 6.73” display, <strong>Gorilla Glass</strong> protection and quick reaction speeds courtesy of <strong>SmartTouch</strong>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/vodafone-mobile-phone-deals/oneplus-9-pro-5g">OnePlus 9 Pro</a></h3>

<p>Charging is also quick and easy with the OnePlus 9 Pro. You can get a day’s power in just <strong>15 minutes</strong> of charging, and there are also <strong>wireless charging</strong> options.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/network/vodafone-sim-only-deals">Vodafone Sim Only Deals</a></h2>

<p>It’s back!&nbsp; The Fonehouse price promise, is returning this February.&nbsp; A Fonehouse crowd favourite from our last Black Friday sale, and for a limited time we are bringing it back to you.</p>



<p>Throughout February, you can be sure to get the very best deal against 8 of the largest mobile phone retailers and resellers. Including Mobile Phones Direct, Carphone Warehouse, Vodafone Direct, Three Direct, Buymobiles, Affordable Mobiles, ChitterChatter, Mobiles.co.uk.</p>



<p>Meaning you can switch and fix a new deal for yourself this February and save some much-needed cashola. <strong>Take that energy price hikes!</strong></p>



<p>Our <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-offers">February mobile deals and price match</a> are offered across all your favourite devices. Including the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">iPhone 13 range</a>, <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsung S21 range</a> alongside budget and entry level devices starting from just £14 / month.</p>



<p>We are price matching daily, so if you see a great deal today, be sure to take advantage as it may not be there tomorrow!</p>



<p>This offer will only last until the end of February. With deals this low, you’d be mad not to upgrade your mobile now to the latest handset covered under our price match. For further details see our <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-offers">mobile phone offers</a>.</p>



<h3 id="join-our-campaign-this-february-to-switch-and-fix-a-great-deal"><strong>Join our campaign this February, to &#8220;Switch and Fix&#8221; a great deal</strong></h3>



<p>Fonehouse has launched a new campaign to help our customers save money. With the ever-increasing costs from everything to food and energy, isn’t it time to save money on your next mobile contract?</p>



<p>If you are coming out of a contract elsewhere, you might be able to save a bundle by switching to a new network and tariff through Fonehouse. Martin Lewis recently highlighted the savings people can make on their <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2022/01/-martin-lewis--paying-more-than-p10-mth-on-your-phone-bill--if-s/">monthly mobile bills</a>.</p>



<p>You too can save if you opt for a SIM only deal through Fonehouse. Although Martin highlighted how <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/best-sim-only-deals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheap SIM plans</a> can go, you’d also best to think about the real data needs you have with you mobile phone. Opting for a cheap 1GB plan will likely leave you at a loss each month when you run out of data.</p>



<p>Fonehouse offers 50GB, 100GB and Unlimited plans to leave you covered for every type of need you can think of. Starting from just £12/month on Vodafone, with 50GB of monthly refresh data and £45 automatic cashback on top (making the monthly line rental effectively £10.13/month) can save you a bundle if you want to keep your same handset.</p>



<p>Or if you can stretch your budget a bit further you can likely save a whole load of cashola from what you pay now by opting for a new contract with a new device and nothing upfront. Take for example the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-5g">Samsung Galaxy S20 FE with 5G</a>, less than 1 year since launch and you can get a 30GB/month data tariff for just £27/month over 24 months. In the UK, the average monthly tariff is around £37/month so that saves you over £240 across 2 years vs. what people pay on average.</p>



<p>Our team can also help you find a way to save this February. You can call our UK customer service team on 0333 900 1133. We are open until 8pm Monday to Thursday, 6pm Fridays and 5.30pm on Saturdays.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Choosing the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/Paymonthly\">perfect mobile data plan</a> can sometimes be a difficult task. You’ve got so many different options and choices that it can really be a difficult task to navigate through all the different deals and plans which offer you all kinds of data options. However, there are a few things that you can do to make sure that you’ve picked the right kind of data plan, and we’re going to be taking a look at these things here to help you.</p>
<h3 style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Consider Data Usage</b></h3>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>One of the first things that you need to do is to consider the amount of data that you’re using on a consistent basis. This will form the beginning of your entire data plan, so you have to know how much data you’re actually using. Are you using a lot every day? Are you just someone who casually browses? These factors will influence whether you’re after a large amount of data or a short amount.</p>
<h3>Narrow Down The Options</h3>
<p>You definitely need to make sure that you narrow down the many many options when you’re looking for a data plan. There’s so many different deals and options. It’s easy to get caught up in the different deals and options that you do wind up feeling like you’re never going to find the best deal for you. It’s a case of looking through all the options and narrowing it down. There will obviously be some deals which just aren’t for you. What’s most important is that you take the data plan which is right for you. Time and time again, we’ve seen people get caught up in a wonderful world of deals, and ultimately get something that’s not any help to them at all. This can obviously be a problem, and a major source of headache.</p>
<h3><strong>Don\&#8217;t Get Sucked In</strong></h3>
<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have said this time and time again. It’s so important that you don’t get caught up and sucked into any kind of deal or offer that isn’t right for you. There’s a lot of different phone deals out there. They all offer different kinds of data and they would all happily sell you something. That doesn’t make it right for you, that just makes it an option. To find your perfect deal, you need to make sure that you can look past all the different options, and find something that will work for you.</p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>Overall, these are just a few of the different steps that you can take to make sure that you are getting the best possible data plan. It can be difficult to find what’s most suited to your needs, but it is absolutely critical that you do. People need to get the deal that’s best for them, and only them. You won’t be happy if you’re trying to find a deal for someone else, so it’s crucial that you take the time to work out what you need. This will make sure you get the data you need, and that you’re not disappointed in any way.</p>
