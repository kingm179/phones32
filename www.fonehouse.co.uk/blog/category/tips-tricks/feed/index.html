To do this head to: <strong>Settings &gt; Advanced Features &gt;Side Key&gt; Enable quick Launch Camera</strong> Option <strong>(sidenote: make sure the Double Press toggle is switched on). </strong>The days of fumbling around trying to launch your camera are over.&nbsp;</p>

With each option you select a slider will appear at the bottom allowing you to adjust exactly how warm or cool you want your display to be. If this isn&#8217;t slider isn&#8217;t enough detail for you don&#8217;t worry, all you have to do is press the <strong>Advanced Settings </strong>button at the bottom of the screen, and RGB sliders will appear allowing you to fine-tune your display even more.&nbsp;</p>

The higher the refresh rate the faster and smoother on-screen visuals become.

<p>Myths and rumours exist around pretty much every topic, mobile phone-based myths being one of the most famous types. When it comes to precious technology you can’t believe everything you hear, and the famous ideas that you might have believed were facts for the last decade might be in fact untrue. Fonehouse is here to debunk a selection of famous mobile myths &#8211; if you’re interested keep scrolling.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Putting Your Phone In Rice </strong></h2>



<p>Putting your mobile phone into rice has been a famous solution to a water damaged phone that&#8217;s been around for decades. You’ve probably done this hack yourself out of desperation or known someone who’s attempted it. However, this phone sparing method is simply just a myth and is the same as just letting your phone dry out on a counter. As soon as liquid hits a non-water resistant device, corrosion is instant. Sometimes we get lucky enough that the liquid doesn’t hit vital internal parts of our device, and sometimes the damage is detrimental. Extensive research has shown that if a person has in fact found their device to be fully functioning after leaving it in rice, it’s most likely because it’s just had the chance to fully dry out. So no matter if you just leave your device on the side, or buried deep in rice the result will be the same. No rice needed.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Keeping Your Bank Card Next To Your Phone Causes Damage&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10300" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>There’s been an ongoing rumour that keeping your bank card and your mobile phone in the same pocket can demagnetize your card, ultimately making it useable, but this in fact is simply untrue. Although all smartphones have a magnetic field, this field is nowhere near strong enough to affect your bank cards. Instead, the prolonged exposure to magnetic fields you should watch out for is on things like fridge magnets and wallet clasps.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Closing Background Running Apps Speeds Up Your Phone and Saves Battery&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1441" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10301" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>You might think that having multiple apps open on your phone can slow it down, however, the majority of modern-day smartphones are tactically built to be able to handle and proficiently optimise running apps whilst others are waiting in the background. Apps open in the background do not use up processing power, RAM or memory because they’re not actively running. This ultimately spares your battery and keeps your device speedy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. The More Megapixels The Better The Camera&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/patrick-robert-doyle-J86zf8g7yGI-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10303" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/patrick-robert-doyle-J86zf8g7yGI-unsplash-edited-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/patrick-robert-doyle-J86zf8g7yGI-unsplash-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/patrick-robert-doyle-J86zf8g7yGI-unsplash-edited-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/patrick-robert-doyle-J86zf8g7yGI-unsplash-edited-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/patrick-robert-doyle-J86zf8g7yGI-unsplash-edited-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/patrick-robert-doyle-J86zf8g7yGI-unsplash-edited-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/patrick-robert-doyle-J86zf8g7yGI-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>People often mistakenly associate a device&#8217;s megapixel count with the quality of the camera. The truth is that the number of megapixels only correlates to how big of a photo your device can take. Instead of focusing on the MP stats when looking for a top-notch smartphone camera, evaluate the sensor quality, the lens set up and image processor specs instead.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>5. Smartphones Give Off Harmful Radiation&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>You’ve probably heard the rumour that smartphones emit harmful radiation. Although it is true that radiation is emitted, this radiation is not harmful at all. Mobile phones emit very low levels of radiofrequency and non-ironizing radiation, and public health data has found no correlation between smartphones and general health.</p>

<h2><strong>How To Preserve Phone Battery Lifespan? &#8211; Avoid Charging Your Battery Beyond 100%</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uniboa-TWFSOvtxjko-unsplash-edited-1-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10220" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uniboa-TWFSOvtxjko-unsplash-edited-1-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uniboa-TWFSOvtxjko-unsplash-edited-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uniboa-TWFSOvtxjko-unsplash-edited-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uniboa-TWFSOvtxjko-unsplash-edited-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uniboa-TWFSOvtxjko-unsplash-edited-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uniboa-TWFSOvtxjko-unsplash-edited-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uniboa-TWFSOvtxjko-unsplash-edited-1-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>It’s night time, you’re all cosy and wrapped up in bed, and you go to put your <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/mobile-phone-cables-and-chargers">phone on charge </a>overnight. The majority of the time your device reaches 100% halfway through the night, and it ends up being overcharged by the time you wake up. This initially might seem like a good thing, however, in the long run, this can actually deteriorate the health of your battery, by shorting its lifespan (in fact this is one of the quickest ways you can deteriorate a battery in general). Instead of this method, perhaps try fully charging your device during the evening instead, and unplug it during the night time. This way the health of your battery will remain intact, and you’ll still have a fully charged device the next day.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Why Does My Phone Lose Battery So Fast? -Reduce Your Screen Brightness</strong></h2>

<p>Modern-day <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals">smartphone </a>screens are big, bright and bold but they’re also massive battery hoggers. Our device&#8217;s brightness level is one huge thing that can determine how fast our battery drains. If you’re in a sticky situation where you need to save battery (if you’re on 1% for example), turn your brightness level right down. It’s probably unlikely that you need your brightness level turned up to 100% anyways unless you’re outside in a dark cave or something.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Turn On Power Saving Mode</strong></h2>



<p>Power saving mode is a handy feature that the majority of tech companies are now including within their devices. This mode reduces the amount of juice your phone needs to run, by slighting reducing the CPU speed of your device in order to save battery. If you have an iPhone you can wait until your device drops down 20%, and you’ll be automatically prompted to turn on power-saving mode. However, if you don&#8217;t want to wait until this point, you can activate power-saving mode manually at any point by heading to <strong>Settings &gt; Battery </strong>and toggling on <strong>&gt; Low Power Mode.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<h2><strong>Shorten The Time Before Your Screen Sleeps</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/yahdi-romelo-Ly6XMmiFXIM-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10225" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/yahdi-romelo-Ly6XMmiFXIM-unsplash-edited-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/yahdi-romelo-Ly6XMmiFXIM-unsplash-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/yahdi-romelo-Ly6XMmiFXIM-unsplash-edited-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/yahdi-romelo-Ly6XMmiFXIM-unsplash-edited-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/yahdi-romelo-Ly6XMmiFXIM-unsplash-edited-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/yahdi-romelo-Ly6XMmiFXIM-unsplash-edited-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/yahdi-romelo-Ly6XMmiFXIM-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>You can save a significant amount of battery power by making sure your screen is off when you don&#8217;t need it. Some of you might be unaware that you can actually change the length of time which has to elapse before your screen sleeps. By opting for a shorter time like 30 seconds or even a minute, your device can instantly cut back on unnecessary battery usage whilst you’re not engaging with it.<strong> </strong>To alter this time iPhone users can head to <strong>Settings &gt; Display &amp; Brightness &gt; Auto-Lock, </strong>and then select your desired time from the drop-down menu. If you’re team Andriod you can go to <strong>Settings &gt; Display &gt; Screen Timeout</strong>, then you should see the current time setting, if you tap this you’ll be asked to select a new time ranging from 15 seconds to 10 minutes. The shorter the time you select, the better battery saving power you’ll get.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Ease Your Location Service Usage&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Location services can be an awesome thing if you’re out and about and you want your friends to know your whereabouts, or even if you want to access to latest location-based Snapchat filters. However, the downfall of your location services constantly being switched on is that it can reduce your battery life quite significantly. There are also various apps that monitor your location too which can use up even more battery. So if you’re just at home perhaps try turning off your handsets location services and see if you notice a difference in how long your battery lasts &#8211; I&#8217;m sure the results will surprise you! To do this <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">iPhone </a>users will have to head to <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy</strong>, and toggle off <strong>Location Services. </strong><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/os/android-mobile-phone-deals">Android</a> users will have to go to <strong>Settings &gt; Connections or Privacy </strong>(depending on which device you have) &gt; <strong>Location</strong> and toggle this off. After this, you’ll be one step closer to longer-lasting battery life.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Which Phone Has Best Battery Life?</strong></h2>



<p>Drumroll please….one device we think is worth all the hype when it comes to the quality and performance of its battery is the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-a52-5g">Samsung Galaxy A52 5G. </a>The device has a 4,500 mAh battery which can last up to two days! This combined with 25W fast charging makes this device in <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/">Fonehouse&#8217;s</a> opinion top tier.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We all have the part of ourselves that deep down that is basically a self-acclaimed photographer. Historically in the early days of mobile phone releases, you had to actually invest in a camera in order to take professional-worthy photos -a lot of effort we know. Nowadays we’re lucky enough to have stunning high-quality cameras which are incorporated within our handsets instead &#8211; professional worthy photography in the palm of our hands. We at Fonehouse want you readers to have the best photo’s possible, so we’ve put together a trustee FAQ guide to phone photography, keep reading and enjoy!</p>



<h2><strong>What Is The Best Phone For Photography?</strong></h2>



<p>There are a lot of amazing handsets on the market which excel when it comes to photography. It seems as if with every device launch, each telecommunications company is trying to outdo each other with how impressive their camera is. One camera we think is worth all the hype is on the<a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-5g"> Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</a>. The rear of this device has an impressive quadruple-camera array. This consists of a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 1080MP Wide-angle lens, a 10MP telephoto lens with 3X Optical Zoom and lastly, a 10MP additional telephoto lens with 10X optical zoom- if reading that just sounded like a bunch to tech talk, in simpler terms this device provides users with crystal clear imagery with wide coverage at a touch of a button</p>



<h2><strong>How To Start Photography With Your Phone&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10311" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>Photography is becoming more popular than ever. Whether that&#8217;s professionally or for fun, it&#8217;s a creative avenue that is truly booming. If you’re a beginner at phone photography we recommend that you start by making use of the handy gridlines feature to balance your shot. By turning this feature on, a series of symmetrical grid lines broken into thirds (horizontally and vertically) will appear on your screen. The theory is that if your subject of interest is within the intersections, this will create tip-top photo composition, and will balance out any empty space &#8211; making your shot instantly more visually appealing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Another tip we recommend you do to get your phone photography game up to the next level is fine-tuning and amending certain aspects of your shots. Smartphones over the years have come a long way. Most phone cameras nowadays autoselect aspects like the brightness, focus and exposure of your shot, but if you take it into your own hands to personalize these instead, it can be a big help in improving the overall quality of your images. On most handsets, once you open your camera app there&#8217;s normally a dial or slider which allows you to adjust the brightness and exposure level. If on the other hand, your camera isn’t focusing the way you&#8217;d like it to, on the majority of devices like<a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals"> iPhones</a> and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsungs</a>, all it takes is a simple tap on the area you want to focus on instead to readjust.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Which Phone Is Best For Night Photography?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10313" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>If you’re a regular nighttime photo taker, the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-11">iPhone 11</a> is an affordable device that has a smashing Night mode for you to indulge in! This is a device that allows you to capture all the beautiful magic within a shot at any hour of the day. The iPhone 11 gets an A star rating when it comes to its top-notch night photography power. If you’re already an iPhone 11 owner, or if you’re looking to purchase one, to turn on Night Mode all you have to do is<strong> open your camera &gt; tap the moon icon </strong>in the left-hand corner, and this icon will turn yellow when the mode is active. To get the best results possible, make sure you have a steady hand and don&#8217;t move your device too quickly after taking the shot (this prevents any annoying blurs from occurring). Nighttime darkness is no longer an interference in the game of photography.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Which Aspect Ratio Is Best For Phone Photography</strong>?</h2>



<p>When it comes to the technicality behind photography, there are little aspects you can tweak which can make a huge difference &#8211; aspect ratio being one of them. The aspect ratio of an image is the ratio of its width and height. It’s been found that there are certain aspect ratio sweet spots, that you can select depending on where you aim to post the photos, which give you the best-looking photos possible. For example, if you’re going to post your photo on Instagram, a 4:5 aspect ratio is recommended due to the platform&#8217;s vertical post layout. Always research your aspect ratios.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Flashback to September 2021, the sparkling new<a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g"> iPhone 13</a> hit the market and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">Apple</a> fans all over the world were eager to get their hands on the new device &#8211; even if that meant queuing up outside of their local Apple store for hours! If you were one of the lucky ones who were able to secure the device, or even if you’re a recent iPhone 13 user, we’ve put together a list of 10 handy iPhone 13 hacks you need to know.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Put A Stop To Apps Tracking You</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve all been in the situation where you’ve typed something random in on an app, and ever since then, you can stop seeing ads/content based on your search. The majority of apps nowadays track various patterns of usage and data whilst you use their app, this is done to serve you more relevant and personalised content in the future. Some people love this tracking feature, but some hate it. For all those who find this feature too invasive, you’ll be happy to hear the iPhone 13 now allows you to block apps from tracking your usage. If you go to <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy</strong> and select ‘<strong>Tracking</strong>’ you should see a toggle at the top of the screen that says ‘Allow Apps to Request to Track’. By turning this toggle off, this will prevent apps from even being able to ask you to track your usage &#8211; no cookies gained, and a final stop to in-app tracking.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Scan Text Through Your Camera</strong></h2>



<p>Pretty much every important document these days is digitalised, whether it’s a contract, an important bill or even your ID. The ‘Live Text’ feature on the iPhone 13 allows you to scan any physical text with your camera, and automatically transfer it over to your device. All you have to do is open your camera, position your device so the text is clearly within the shot, and a yellow frame should appear around the detected text. Then you should be able to manipulate the grab points you want and then copy and paste the text into any space of your choosing (your notes app for example). This super cool feature also works with photos you’ve previously taken. All you have to do is simply go to your camera roll, highlight any text within a photo, then you should be able to copy it and paste it elsewhere &#8211; pretty cool stuff right?<br><br></p>



<h2><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Facetime With Non-Apple Users</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="489" height="1024" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-facetime-web-android-call-in-progress-489x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10046" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-facetime-web-android-call-in-progress-72x150.png 72w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-facetime-web-android-call-in-progress-143x300.png 143w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-facetime-web-android-call-in-progress-489x1024.png 489w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-facetime-web-android-call-in-progress.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px" /></figure>



<p>Facetime over the years has become a huge hit amongst Apple users, but I&#8217;m sure everyone has a friend who is solely team Andriod. But did you know that you can actually Facetime with someone who doesn&#8217;t own an Apple product? &#8211; A Windows or Android user for example. All you have to do is go into Facetime &gt; Select Create Link &gt; Press Copy, and then you can send this link through messages or even email.&nbsp; Any person on the receiving end of this link no matter what device they’re on will automatically be able to Facetime with you. We think Facetime is so great that everyone should be able to enjoy it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Send Web Pages Via Siri</strong></h2>



<p>As humans, we’re constantly interacting with our friends via our phones, whether that&#8217;s an actual phone conversation, or simply sending memes back and forth. If you’re on a webpage you want to show a friend, instead of copying and pasting the link, you can now get the famous Siri to do all the hard work for you. All you have to do is whilst on the web page, say “Hey Siri send this to *insert friend name*”. Then Siri will then automatically copy this link and send it over to the person of your choice via text message. Sending content made easy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>5. Turn Your Live Pictures Into Videos</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve all probably played around with the famous ‘Live Photos’ option on our iPhone cameras. But these types of photos can only be played within our camera rolls if we press the image and hold down. However, if you press the ‘Share’ icon on any live photo of your choice (which is located in the bottom left-hand corner), scroll down and then select <strong>‘Save As Video’</strong>. This will then save your live photo as a 3-second video instead within your main camera roll &#8211; you’ll be surprised as to just how much is captured within only 3 seconds! The hassle of holding down your live photos just to view them is finally over.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>6. Require Attention For Face ID</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="664" height="910" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-settings-face-id.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10047" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-settings-face-id-109x150.png 109w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-settings-face-id-219x300.png 219w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-settings-face-id.png 664w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /></figure>



<p>I&#8217;m sure you’ve seen all the funny tweets online of people expressing their worries about their <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">iPhone</a> being unlocked via Face ID whilst they’re asleep &#8211; I mean it is a pretty valid concern. Well, you’ll be thrilled to hear that you can actually stop this travesty from happening. If you go to your Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode &gt; and make sure both the ‘Require Attention For Face ID’ and ‘Attention Aware Features’ toggles are both on. This will then require both your eyes to be open and looking at the screen in order to unlock your device via Face ID. Even if this isn’t a concern for you, it’s still recommended that you do this as an extra level of protection for your device&#8217;s sensitive data.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>7. Bundle Non-Important Notifications </strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="506" height="1024" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-lock-screen-notification-summary-506x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10045" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-lock-screen-notification-summary-74x150.png 74w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-lock-screen-notification-summary-148x300.png 148w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-lock-screen-notification-summary-506x1024.png 506w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-lock-screen-notification-summary.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /></figure>



<p>If you’re a person who is a serial app downloader you probably get a million unimportant notifications a day ranging from 20% off sales to new filters being available -which at times can be distracting. iOS 15 has a cool feature called ‘Notification Summary’ which enables you to bundle all the less important notifications together and allows you to receive them at the same time rather than receiving random pings throughout the day. To do this all you have to do is go to <strong>Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Scheduled Summary &gt;</strong> then<strong> toggle this on</strong>. After this, you’ll automatically be taken to a setup page where you can scroll select the apps you deem less important and want to include within your summary (you can make as many different summary groups as you want). After you’ve added the apps to your summary you can now schedule specific times you want these notifications to appear as a group. Once this is done, all you’ll need to do is press the ‘Turn On Notification Summary’ button at the bottom, and from now on only the apps that aren&#8217;t included within your summaries (i.e the important ones) will show immediately and at whatever time throughout your day.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>8. Double Tap The Back Of Your iPhone</strong> <strong>To Screenshot</strong></h2>



<p>Fumbling to press the right buttons in order to take a simple screenshot can be quite annoying. With the right accessibility function enabled you can simply tap twice on the back of your iPhone 13 to take a screenshot instead. Head to <strong>Settings &gt; Accesbaility &gt; Touch &gt; Back Tap &gt; Double-tap </strong>and then find ‘<strong>Screenshot’ </strong>within the presented list (warning you might have to do a bit of scrolling). Now when you double-tap the back of your iPhone it will now take a screenshot! No more faffing around with buttons.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>9. Photographic Styles</strong></h2>



<p>Another cool new camera feature on the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g">iPhone 13</a> is Photographic Styles. Unlike your bog-standard filters, Photographic Styles allows you to adjust and fine-tune aspects like warmth, brightness and contrast to create an aesthetic that will be applied to all of the photos you take. To use this head to your <strong>Camera</strong>, and select the camera controls button &nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="20" height="20" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9NqMZJsLtHkxbIc3HuHfwgb8QPfI5W7JCjUxX5e33xm8-D6zm1qnqza9iJuub2_6WXOXBBJ2Srw_9lHgphLT06DqVYZNbap29G04ljQsH-v7qxs4HIzvLiYAHqZK4ZLivnjbIUK5" alt="the Camera Controls button">. Then select the photographic styles button <img loading="lazy" width="20" height="23" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GzXWWp24j2SV-SBsURWSFZEaoNrU8X1Q4h9RORh9XuMz_0bN2pgDg8W2g5iTCoNQLkVZdREIKOi6buut2TAlDzCYwndmKOHWWkPTD7FHHhvZkJlNrDN23_LMXDmipoZGhxPz-ntu" alt="the Photographic Styles button">. Swipe left to a get a preview of all the different styles, and if desired customise the style by tapping the Tone and Warmth controls which sit below the frame. Lastly, tap the photographic style button again <img loading="lazy" width="27" height="31" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_cz7LGz1xMrhTUe0PCa9C5lqxOlvTf-HU-6oLS_FLLKr7TRAnSiOmvtYbqJUI03XcJO2aZxU5aUJMYhHVitH2NveYOYBHtw3BgwDwshMMwCsv-4IaZfDdwa_SvgCRoA93OOqfjO1" alt="the Photographic Styles button"> to apply the style to your camera.</p>



<p>If you perhaps have a change of heart and want to change your photographic style at any point, just select the photographic styles icon again at the top of your screen.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>10. Keyboard To Trackpad</strong></h2>



<p>Sometimes it can be quite tricky to precisely move your cursor whilst you’re typing on your iPhone &#8211; especially if it&#8217;s a lengthy bit of text. To defeat this issue you can actually turn your keyboard into a trackpad, instantly giving you better precision whilst navigating through text on your device. To do this is simple. All you have to do is press and hold the space bar while typing (this will then make any other keys grey out). Then swipe your finger across the spacebar (still holding down on the screen) to enter keyboard trackpad mode. Now you’ll be able to move your text cursor anywhere on your screen with immaculate precision. To exit this mode just simply lift your finger. Once you try this you’ll never go back to standard text selection again.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="480" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/phone-care-1024x480.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10013" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/phone-care-150x70.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/phone-care-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/phone-care-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/phone-care-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/phone-care.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When we first invest in a shiny new handset, we become obsessed with the idea of it remaining perfect &#8211; scratch, smear and blemish-free. So much so that some of us even leave the plastic coating that the phone came in on for weeks. Mobile maintenance can be tough. With so many accessories on the market, it’s hard to know which ones are effective and worth your while. This step-by-step guide will give you all the tips and tricks on how to care for your mobile phone to the best of your ability.</p>



<h2><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Buy A Protective Case</strong></h2>



<p>After you’ve researched, added to your basket and paid for your new device, the first thing you should do is purchase <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/mobile-phone-cases">a phone case</a>. A durable phone case will shield your device from any drops, spills and other clumsy mistakes that you might make throughout your journey with your handset. Fonehouse has some of the best mobile phone cases in the market for all different types of devices ranging from Apple to Samsung, Huawei to Sony. Various different accident-proof materials such as silicone and hard-shell plastic are also up for grabs. You can even buy protective mobile cases which have built-in cardholders!</p>



<h2><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Protect Your Screen</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="854" height="600" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/screen-protector.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10014" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/screen-protector-150x105.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/screen-protector-300x211.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/screen-protector-768x540.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/screen-protector.jpg 854w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></figure>



<p>We’ve all probably smashed or scratched our mobile screen once or twice in our lives, right? To avoid this tragedy, we suggest you save yourself the trouble and buy yourself a mobile phone <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/screen-protector">screen protector</a>. Although the screens on modern-day smartphones are becoming more smash and scratch-resistant this is not 100%, and there is still a chance that your screen can face damage. Something as small as a coin in your pocket can cause some small but extremely irritating damage to your screen. A tempered glass screen protector will act as a barrier between the world and your device, if damaged you can easily remove and reapply a new one &#8211; it’s better to be safe than sorry. If you want to know how to fit a screen protector to your mobile phone, check out this quick <a href="https://youtu.be/LpYCVneB4ko">video!</a></p>



<h2><strong>Step 3 &#8211;</strong> <strong>Mobile Phone Battery</strong> <strong>Maintenace</strong></h2>



<p>Make sure your charger is legitimate. Sometimes the use of inauthentic third-party charging accessories can <a href="https://www.electronicproducts.com/how-a-fake-charger-is-killing-your-phones-battery-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/">deteriorate the quality of your battery</a>. If your handset on delivery came with a charging cable in the box, you’re in luck! Currently, more companies are opting for a smaller box on delivery, and not including chargers with new devices. Fonehouse has a wide selection of authentic charging accessories ranging from <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/iphone-lightning-cable-1m-white-devia">lightning cables </a><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/mobile-phone-cables-and-chargers">to</a><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/wireless-ultra-slim-charging-pad-black-10w-devia"> wireless charging pads</a> to give your battery the healthy boost that it needs. Don’t forget to not overcharge your device! Regular overcharging is another thing that can take a toll on your battery health over time.</p>



<h2><strong>Step 4 -Keep It Clean</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="854" height="600" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/keep-it-clean.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10016" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/keep-it-clean-150x105.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/keep-it-clean-300x211.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/keep-it-clean-768x540.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/keep-it-clean.jpg 854w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></figure>



<p>This step isn’t essential to making your handset last, but it could be a big help in maintaining the overall cleanliness and quality of your device. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=mobile+cleaning+kit&amp;crid=2Y7R7CBCH2ASD&amp;sprefix=mobile+clean%2Caps%2C114&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_3_12">Cleaning kits </a>are available for the majority of devices. These kits typically include specifically shaped foam-tipped swabs to get into the tiny nooks and crannies of your device that are hard to reach, and where dirt builds up such as the headphone jack and microphone. Clearing these areas from build-up can not only improve the quality of your audio (input &amp; output) but it also leaves your device looking visibly cleaner. Anti-smear fabric or disposable wipes are also what you can expect within a kit, perfect for wiping away stains and build-up. If you’re lucky another item you’ll receive in a standard cleaning kit is a Nylon cleaning brush, this can be used to wipe away any dirt and is also great for using on other gadgets you might have like tablets and laptops.</p>



<h2><strong>Step 5 &#8211;</strong> <strong>Be</strong> <strong>Wise</strong></h2>



<p>The final step is about choices rather than a purchase. It might be common sense but try not to do anything too crazy with your device. The less risk, the better. Although some modern-day smartphones like the<a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g"> iPhone 13</a> have cool features like 6-metre water resistance and dust resistance, mobile phones aren’t completely invincible… yet. Be smart with your handset.</p>

<p>When it comes to mobile contracts everybody wants to cut back on costs &#8211; especially with the price of living increasing. You shouldn’t have to feel torn between picking a plan that you require usage wise and saving money. We’re here to help you out and give you Fonehouse’s top 5 tips for saving money on your monthly mobile phone bill.</p>



<h2><strong>Tip 1: Consider A SIM Only Contract</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="480" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sim-only-mobile-deals-1024x480.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10025" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sim-only-mobile-deals-150x70.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sim-only-mobile-deals-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sim-only-mobile-deals-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sim-only-mobile-deals-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sim-only-mobile-deals.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/best-sim-only-deals">Sim-Only contracts</a> are taking over. These types of contracts are perfect for those who perhaps have an old device they want to continue using, or for people who have purchased a new device outright. SIM-Only contracts only require customers to pay a super cheap monthly bill for a SIM card with a text, minutes and data bundle included &#8211; a cheap solution to cutting costs. Not only are SIM-only contracts affordable (typically ranging from just £6 to £15 per month), but there&#8217;s a huge selection of plans up for grabs for all different types of users. Whether you love to constantly watch YouTube videos and Tik-Toks whilst on the go, or if you keep your data usage to a minimum, there will always be a specific SIM-Only plan for you.</p>



<h2><strong>Tip 2: Tailoring Your Search</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="393" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/website-filter-deals-1024x393.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10026" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/website-filter-deals-150x58.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/website-filter-deals-300x115.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/website-filter-deals-768x295.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/website-filter-deals-1024x393.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/website-filter-deals.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>You’ve just got paid, your old handset is a bust, you have a dream mobile in mind, but you don&#8217;t want to splash too much cash &#8211; this is where tailoring your search comes in. On Fonehouse depending on which device you’re interested in, under the &#8216;Sort By&#8217; tab you can narrow down the different available contracts into three different sections: Effective Cost, Popularity, and Total Cost. The ‘Effective Cost’ option will be your best friend when it comes to saving money on your mobile contract. After you select this, Fonehouse does all the hard work and ranks which contracts will allow you to get the most for your money, in terms of data, minutes and texts. We at Fonehouse ensure customers only pay the best and fairest prices for what they receive &#8211; no extortionate pricing over here.</p>



<h2><strong>Tip 3: Always Check The Deals Page</strong></h2>



<p>Who doesn’t love a good deal? Every month Fonehouse release an amazing set of <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-offers">special offers</a> for tech-loving customers to get their hands on and enjoy. These offers range from price-matched <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-pro-5g-128gb-graphite">iPhone 13 Pro 5Gs</a> to <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-128gb-phantom-white">Samsung Galaxy S21 5Gs</a> &#8211; there really is a deal for everyone. If none of the current Fonehouse deals takes your fancy, check back the following month, we’re always updating our deals to give customers the best, and most exclusive offers possible.</p>



<h2><strong>Tip 4: Maybe Consider A Contract On A Refurbished Handset</strong></h2>



<div class="wp-block-image"><figure class="aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="590" height="304" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Trade-In-Logo.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10027" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Trade-In-Logo-150x77.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Trade-In-Logo-300x155.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Trade-In-Logo.png 590w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px" /></figure></div>





<p>Taking out a contract on a<a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/refurbished-mobile-phone-deals"> refurbished device</a> is usually considerably cheaper than taking out a contract on a brand-new device. Don&#8217;t worry we don’t slack when it comes to quality, Fonehouse ensures that all the refurbished devices we sell are tested fully, fully functioning and come with a 12-month warranty. Our refurbished mobile phone deals section has a bit of everything from <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/refurbished-mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g">iPhone 12 5Gs</a> to <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/refurbished-mobile-phone-deals/xiaomi-redmi-10">Xiaomi Redmi 10s</a> at extremely low monthly rates. Like the sound of what you hear? maybe a refurbished handset is the way forward for you.</p>



<h2><strong>Tip 5: Use Fonehouse’s Trustee Trade-In Service, Great Money Towards A New Device</strong></h2>



<p>If you didn&#8217;t think Fonehouse could get any better, you just have to hear about our reliable <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/sell-my-mobile">trade-in service</a>! The Fonehouse website allows you to input a device you want to get off your hands and sell and provides you with an instant quote.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Your handset should last you for several years – after all, you expect this when they cost a good amount of money upfront. However, it is important to remember, as with anything you purchase that you do need to look after your device to ensure its longevity.</p>



<p>There are various things you can do to actually extend the life of your <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals">mobile phone</a>, and in this guide, we have pulled together our top tips on looking after either your <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsung</a> device to ensure it lasts longer before you need to replace it.</p>



<p>If you do need to get your phone repaired, you’re in luck as in our Fonehouse stores we have a phone repair service – so you can get even longer out of your device! Find your nearest store with our <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/store-finder">store finder.</a></p>



<h2>How to Make your Phone Battery Last Longer</h2>



<p>Over time phones naturally see their battery life decline. However, whilst this is normal you can actually slow this down.</p>



<p>Lithium-ion batteries (the ones used in smartphones) chemically age over time so as the years go by they hold less charge. Whilst this process is inevitable, did you know you could be doing things that speed the process up?</p>



<p>To maximise the battery life on your handset you should keep the battery charged to somewhere between 30% and 80%. Over 80% the battery can age faster – and the same for if it goes below 20%. Below 20% the battery draws out more current which makes the battery life decrease.</p>



<p><strong>When it comes to the iPhone, </strong>on iOS 13 and later you can actually enable a function called ‘Optimized Battery Charging’ which is designed to decrease battery ageing. This feature reduces the amount of time your iPhone spends fully charged so fully charging over 80% is delayed or not carried out. You can enable this function by going to <strong>Settings &gt;Battery &gt; Battery Health &gt; Switch on Optimized Battery Charging</strong>.</p>



<p>For those who are concerned about charging their iPhone to 100%, you need not worry – a full recharge isn’t the end of the world but fully recharging every time will shorten your device’s lifespan. Another top tip is to turn your phone off whilst charging, or at least try not to use it.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phone-battery-usage-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9055" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phone-battery-usage-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phone-battery-usage-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phone-battery-usage-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phone-battery-usage-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phone-battery-usage-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phone-battery-usage-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>How to Manage Battery Usage on iPhone</h2>



<p>Continuing with the battery theme, you can easily manage your device’s battery life by viewing the usage by each app in <strong>Settings &gt; Battery. </strong>Some apps drain your battery more than others, so you can use this information to cut down on those apps that drain your battery the most. Other than cutting down on battery draining apps you can also optimise battery life by:</p>



<ul><li>Turning your device’s brightness down or switching to Dark Mode.</li><li>Turn off background app refresh, this stops apps draining your battery when they are not even in use.

<h2>How to Manage Battery Usage on Samsung</h2>



<p>On Samsung phones, you can follow a similar method to manage battery usage. Simply go to <strong>Settings &gt; Battery and device care &gt; Battery </strong>to view the usage by each app and then try to cut down on those that drain your battery. &nbsp;Additionally, you can do the following to cut down on battery usage even further:</p>



<ul><li>Switch to Dark Mode or turn down the phone’s brightness.</li><li>Select a sleep status for certain apps to prevent them running in the background by going to <strong>Battery &gt; See more &gt; Settings &gt; Sleeping apps &gt; Add to select apps you want in sleep status &gt; Add</strong></li><li>Turn off location services on apps that don’t need them by <strong>Holding the chosen app icon &gt; App info &gt; Permissions &gt; Location &gt; Deny</strong></li><li>Turning off push notifications when they are not needed by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; See all &gt; apps that most recently sent you a notification. If you can&#8217;t find the app you want, tap Most recent &gt; All &gt; Search for the app &gt; When you&#8217;ve found your app, tap to turn it off.</strong></li><li>Use WiFi wherever possible.</li><li>Switch to Power Saving Mode.</li><li>Adjust your screen time out so that your device will go dark when not in use. You can do this in <strong>Apps &gt; Settings &gt; Display &gt; Screen Time Out</strong>.</li></ul>



<h2>Temperature</h2>



<p>Being exposed consistently to high temperatures can damage your phones battery life permanently. The same goes for extremely cold temperatures but this will only be temporary.</p>



<p>iPhone’s ideal temperature is 16° C to 22°C but they can work best at 0°C to 35° C. For Samsungs the best temperature is also 0°C to 35° C.</p>



<h2>How to Replace a Broken Battery</h2>



<p>Many people will decide to get a new phone when their battery starts to worsen. However, if you are looking for a cost-effective way to extend the lifespan of your iPhone or Samsung phone, replacing the battery could be your best solution.</p>



<h2>Updating the Operating System</h2>



<h2>iOS</h2>



<p>You may have heard through the grapevine updating your <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/os/ios-mobile-phone-deals">iOS</a> can cause problems for older iPhones, but this is simply not the case – in fact, it is the opposite. It is essential to update your iPhone’s operating system to fix bugs, security issues and to add new features. The purpose of an iOS update is to improve the overall performance of your device – including ensuring it works quicker. You can choose to automatically install iOS updates to your device so that you never forget!</p>



<h2>Samsung OS</h2>



<p>Updating your Samsung operating system as required is essential to expanding the lifespan of your device. It helps to solve problems, fix bugs and improves performance. You can keep your device up to date by switching on <strong>auto-update</strong> on Lollipop/KitKat devices or <strong>Download updates automatically</strong> on Marshmallow devices and above.</p>



<h2>Updating your Apps</h2>



<p>It is important that you look through your apps often and remove any that you no longer use – to save storage and prevent them using battery life in the background. It is also important to update the apps you do use – again, you can set this to automatic, so you don’t forget.</p>



<p>On Samsung devices you have the option to auto-disable apps that haven’t been used for 30 days in <strong>Battery &gt; See more &gt; toggle Auto disable unused apps.</strong></p>



<p>Whilst we’re on the topic of apps, it is important to remember not to force quit apps unless they are unresponsive. This is because your operating system will pause apps not in use and this uses less power than repeatedly quitting and re-opening them.</p>



<h2>Storage</h2>



<p>If you have noticed your phone slowing down, you might want to look at your storage capacity.</p>



<p>When iPhone’s storage gets full it can slow down the functions of the device. To free up storage delete any unwanted images, videos, files and documents or back them up to iCloud.</p>



<p>The same goes for Samsung phones, you want to make sure you are managing storage to ensure your phone is running to its best ability. Did you know old text messages and voicemails can take up storage too? Make sure to go through and delete these if you can.</p>



<h2>Delete your Cache</h2>



<p>Your phone will collect a lot of cached data over time that you don’t need. This can impact your phone’s memory so clearing it out occasionally can help to free up storage space and can improve overall performance.</p>



<p>There are a few different ways you can do this on an iPhone, and it might vary depending on your apps – but start by checking each app in the iPhone Storage section of your settings. You can click on each and see if there is an option to clear cache – if not, try uninstalling and reinstalling each app.</p>



<p>On a Samsung Device to clear app cache go to <strong>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Click on an often-used app &gt; Storage &gt; Clear Cache</strong>.</p>



<h2>Accessories</h2>



<p>Choosing the right <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories">phone accessories</a> for your device can play a big part in its lifespan – make sure you invest in things such as a <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/screen-protector">screen protector</a> and a case to protect it from damage. When it comes to charging we do recommend only using the charger that came with your device or one that is certified as ‘Made for iPhone’ or ‘Samsung-approved’ depending on your device.</p>

<h2>Cleaning your Charging Port</h2>



<p>Dust and dirt can easily make its way into your charging port, shine a light into the port and if you can see dust or dirt you need to give it a clean. You can do this using a toothpick to gently dislodge any grime that is in there.</p>



<p>We hope that with this guide you know everything you need to about better looking after your Samsung or iPhone and that you can increase the lifespan of your current device.

<p>There are so many different FaceTime features you will love from the latest iOS update. They make video calling so much more fun! Once you’ve learnt all about its very best features, we’re sure you’ll want to jump on FaceTime calls right away. It definitely makes this online social life a lot more fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is FaceTime?</h2>
<p>FaceTime is something that has been on Apple devices since the very beginning. It’s gone through a number of different face lifts and changes to get it to where it is now. FaceTime is the Apple default app, which you can use to video call other Apple devices.There’s are so many FaceTime features you will love that you’re going to want to pay attention to as well!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What devices can use it?</h2>
<p>FaceTime is actually available on all iOS devices, even Apple watches! Depending on how old your device is depends on whether or not you’ll be able to use all the features. The best FaceTime variants come from iOS 12. This means that if you’ve got anything later than an iPhone 6, you may not be able to enjoy all the best features.</p>
<p>A few middle eastern countries don’t allow FaceTime on their Apple devices. This is because a lot of countries calls are tapped and traced to avoid terrorism threats. With the Apple encryption policies, they cannot tap into any FaceTime calls, therefore banning this feature. FaceTime is not available in the United Arab Emirates for these reasons however, it is enabled in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Group Video Calls</h2>
<p>A huge perk of FaceTime is that you can have up to 32 people on one call. This is perfect to catch up with everyone at once. The group call feature comes from iOS 12. This means that the majority of iPhones will have access to this feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to add multiple people to your FaceTime call, you can click ‘Add People’ to dial in other contacts. You do have to already be on a FaceTime call in order to get this button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way you can start group calls is from group iMessages. When you click into an iMessage group chat, you’ll be able to call other contacts by clicking the information button at the top. Here you’ll be able to enter a group call, which calls the entire group at one time. When the call is active, users can join and leave whilst without dialling in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Effects and Stickers</h2>
<p>The latest iOS update gives FaceTime users loads of new effects and stickers to enjoy. Using the effects, you can turn yourself into a Memoji or Animoji. The infrared sensors in the iPhone tracks your facial movement, making the Animoji or Memoji move with you. This includes mouth movement, eye movement, even micro expressions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also add all Apple emojis as stickers to the screen. When you place the stickers, they’ll pin to the area you put them. This means stickers remain where you have put them, even when you move.</p>
<p>You also have the option to add text to the screen too. You can edit this to say exactly what you want it to. There are a number of different fonts available from classic fonts to super exciting one.</p>
<p>You will only be able to use these features on devices with Face ID. This is because infrared is used to track your face to meet the movements. Only devices with Face ID have inferred sensors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Complete Privacy&nbsp;</h2>
<p>A huge perk of using FaceTime over any other video cal app is that is has end-to-end encryption. Privacy is something that’s incredibly important to Apple. This means that all of your calls and messages are completely private, even Apple can’t listen to your calls or view your messages. FaceTime calls are never recorded or intercepted by anyone. The only think Apple keeps track of is who called who for up to 30 days.&nbsp; They don’t even keep track of the duration of calls or whether&nbsp; call was answered or not.&nbsp;</p>
