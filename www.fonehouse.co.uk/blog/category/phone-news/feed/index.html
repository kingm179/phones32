										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Broadband cellular networks are constantly evolving and being improved as years go by. When it comes to technology, nothing is ever stationary. In recent years the main battle has been between 4G and 5G. If you’re in the market for a new device, and you aren’t sure whether to opt for a 4G or 5G compatible one or if you perhaps just want to know more about the main differences between the two cellular networks, keep on reading.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What is 4G?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>4G is the fourth generation broadband cellular network that followed 3G. When it first hit the market in 2009, this network promised aspects such as faster download speeds (up to twenty times faster than 3G), clearer voice calls, higher bandwidth, and better spectral efficiency. As you can imagine tech lovers all over the world were eager to start using the new 4G service, this was a huge improvement in the world of tech compared to the previously developed cellular network.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What is 5G?</strong></h2>



<p>Many people have labelled 5G as the future &#8211; a big statement we know. Released in April 2019, 5G was the shiny new fifth-generation mobile network on the scene, and to this day it is the latest addition to the broadband cellular network list. 5G provides impressive things such as a greater speed in transmissions (increasing the speed in which your device performs actions), lower latency (which shortens the time between an order we give to our device and when the action occurs, and a greater amount of connected devices being available. 5G ultimately has improved the quality of the majority of things we do on our devices from streaming to downloading content.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How does 5G Work vs 4G</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rostyslav-savchyn-9XtjVafxMUg-unsplash-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10199" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rostyslav-savchyn-9XtjVafxMUg-unsplash-150x113.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rostyslav-savchyn-9XtjVafxMUg-unsplash-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rostyslav-savchyn-9XtjVafxMUg-unsplash-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rostyslav-savchyn-9XtjVafxMUg-unsplash-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rostyslav-savchyn-9XtjVafxMUg-unsplash-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rostyslav-savchyn-9XtjVafxMUg-unsplash-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rostyslav-savchyn-9XtjVafxMUg-unsplash-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rostyslav-savchyn-9XtjVafxMUg-unsplash-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/rostyslav-savchyn-9XtjVafxMUg-unsplash-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>If we focus on the technicality behind 4G vs 5G, 4G uses larger wavelengths at lower frequencies. Alternatively, 5G uses much smaller wavelengths at higher frequencies, this method being more effective, supports a lot more simultaneous connections than 4G. More simultaneous connections means that if you’re in a heavily populated area such as a festival or in the heart of a city centre for example, your connectivity remains consistent.&nbsp; If that just sounded like a bunch of tech talk, the technicality/structure behind 5G is much more efficient and effective at providing quicker speeds than 4G- another win for 5G.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How Fast Is 4G?</strong></h2>



<p>The latency behind 4G sits around the 20-30 millisecond mark. The cellular network also has an average download/upload speed of 36.4Mbps and a peak download speed of 90+Mbps -pretty decent efficiency and speed for the majority of devices.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>How Fast Is 5G?</strong></h2>



<p>5G is considerably faster than 4G. 5G has an average download/upload speed of 100 &#8211; 200Mbps, and a peak download speed of 753+ Mbps. Of course, these numbers can fluctuate depending on your network provider, however, across all providers, 5G always comes out on top over 4G.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Which Network Has Better 5G Coverage?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/frederik-lipfert-y67dwfB2AiM-unsplash-1024x683.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10197" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/frederik-lipfert-y67dwfB2AiM-unsplash-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/frederik-lipfert-y67dwfB2AiM-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/frederik-lipfert-y67dwfB2AiM-unsplash-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/frederik-lipfert-y67dwfB2AiM-unsplash-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/frederik-lipfert-y67dwfB2AiM-unsplash-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/frederik-lipfert-y67dwfB2AiM-unsplash-2048x1365.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Comparing the two big dog networks <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/network/three-mobile-phone-deals">Three </a>and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/network/vodafone-mobile-phone-deals">Vodafone</a>, Three in fact has more 5G coverage across UK cities and towns. Three claims to have 5G service in over 300 locations across the UK, whereas, Vodafone&#8217;s UK 5G coverage currently sits in 120+ locations.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Which Network has the fastest Median 5G Download Speeds?</strong></h2>



<p>Three comes out on top when it comes to their median 5G download speed, which currently sits at 231.07 Mbps. Although Vodafone doesn&#8217;t fall far behind with a median 5G download speed of 159.49 Mbps. Either way, no matter what network you opt for, your median 5G download speed will be super speedy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Overall Who Wins?</strong></h2>



<p>After reaching the end of this blog you’ve probably come to the conclusion that 5G is in fact better than 4G, and we’re happy to announce you’re right. 5G being the latest cellular network addition comes out top in providing users with faster speeds. However, this doesn&#8217;t mean that 4G is bad, I mean a lot of devices still run on this broadband cellular network perfectly fine. In terms of networks Three wins the competition in terms of the coverage and speed of its 5G service, however, Vodafone is still an amazing 5G option up for grabs. Whether you opt for Vodafone or Three both 5G services are a win-win either way.</p>

<p>When it comes to getting great deals on products just in time for Christmas, then <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/black-friday-phone-deals\">Black Friday</a> is a great time to start, especially with our Vodafone Black Friday deals. This year November 26th is the date to mark on your calendars as we take a look at some of the best deals you will see on Vodafone handsets.</p>
<h2><strong>Do Your Research</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to getting the best deal, you want to start your research sooner rather than later. There is a huge range of different handsets on the market. With the growth of the Vodafone 5G network then this is only going to increase the number of new devices hitting the market. So, you want to make sure you know exactly what phone it is that you are going to be aiming for.</p>
<h2><strong>To 5G or Not to 5G?</strong></h2>
<p>5G has grown massively in the last year. It hasn&#8217;t reached everywhere yet, but it will do.&nbsp; Given that all networks have been upgraded to 5G, you might decide that now is the right time to upgrade to 5G.</p>
<h2><strong>Handsets to Watch For</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to picking your handset there are some fantastic models out there to choose from that are all likely to see deals on Black Friday. The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/basket/add/contract/iphone-13-5g-128gb-midnight/vodafone-47pm-25gb-red-plan-band-5-new/free-delivery?source=sale3">iPhone 13</a> is a stunning piece of kit from Apple and their best phone on the market currently. If you are an Apple fan, then this is the mobile you should go to. Apple doesn&#8217;t often offer discounts on their kit, but Black Friday is normally an exception. Vodafone are known for their market leading Black Friday phone deals so you\&#8217;re going to want to keep an eye out for this one.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Rising Stars</strong></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/basket/add/contract/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-5g-128gb-cream/vodafone-50pm-unlimited-unlimited-band-6-new/free-delivery?source=sale3">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip </a>line is another flagship phone to hit 2021 and what&#8217;s not to love about the new <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/basket/add/contract/google-pixel-6-5g-128gb-stormy-black/vodafone-33pm-150gb-red-plan-band-9-new-100gb-8mrcd/free-delivery?source=sale3">Google Pixel 6 5G</a> device.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Year-Round Deals</strong></h2>

It first appeared in the UK in 2010, when Amazon ran a Black Friday sale, and it has grown ever since.</p>



<p>What was once confined to one day only (in addition to Cyber Monday, of course) now spans the majority of November. This means, you don’t even have to wait for the big day anymore you can bag a bargain before Black Friday in some cases!</p>



<h2>Black Friday at Fonehouse</h2>



<p>It should come as no surprise that we wanted to get in on the Black Friday action as early as possible – after all mobile phone deals are what we do best! Therefore, we will be starting our Black Friday sale weeks ahead of the big day itself – make sure to watch out for everything we have in store over the next few weeks!</p>

<p>You can expect to see some of the best Black Friday deals around – across the biggest brands! And we are so sure of ourselves and our deals that this year we are offering a price promise.</p>



<h2><em>Fonehouse’s Black Friday Price Promise</em></h2>



<p>At Fonehouse, we are so sure that our deals are the best that we are offering a price promise (<a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/images/misc/black-friday/price-promise-terms.pdf">terms and conditions</a> apply). What this means is that you can shop our deals from the minute our sale goes live, and if you have a better deal on Black Friday on your chosen phone, we will match the price. This also works if you find a better deal elsewhere – we will match it! So, you can be sure you are getting the best deal at Fonehouse this Black Friday!</p>



<h2>What Kind of Black Friday Shopper are You?</h2>



<p>Whether you love it or hate it, Black Friday deals really are too good to miss. We are sure you have seen the various images from previous years of the stampedes in supermarkets to grab the best TV deals, or people camping outside shops waiting for the Black Friday sale shopping to commence – however, we’ve come along way since then, and we all shop differently.</p>



<p>Will you be heading to the shops to brave the crowds? Or, sitting in front of the computer ready to bag an online bargain? Let’s take a look at the different types of Black Friday shoppers.</p>



<h2>Traditional Black Friday Shoppers</h2>



<p>The traditional Black Friday shopper is someone who lives for a sale. They have been bargain hunting their entire life, and the thought of sale shopping excites them. They get up early to get there as soon as the shops open and hop from store to store throughout the day. The traditional Black Friday shopper loves the entire experience.</p>



<h2>The Competitive Black Friday Shoppers</h2>



<p>The competitive Black Friday shoppers can be a little scary if you aren’t one of them. They love the thrill of sale shopping and grabbing the biggest bargains (whether they need them, or not) and they aren’t afraid of pushing people out of the way to do so!</p>



<h2>The Online Deal Hunter</h2>



<p>The online deal hunter stays home on Black Friday, away from the shops at all costs. They have plenty of tabs open and are hunting on their favourite online stores for the best deals. They will have signed up for all the newsletters and be crawling their emails ready for the big day.</p>



<h2>The Strategic Shopper</h2>



<p>The strategic shopper plans in advance. They know exactly what they are looking for on Black Friday and they are going to get the best deals. They have probably already bagged some bargains in the lead up to the day itself. They have all their accounts set up online to check out as fast as possible and have already hit the shops to avoid the mad rush on the day.</p>



<h2>The Avoiders</h2>



<p>Finally, we have the Black Friday avoiders – those who loathe the day entirely and avoid the shops completely. However, we reckon they still hunt for a sneaky online deal – who can resist!</p>



<p><em>Which Black Friday Shopper are you?</em></p>



<h2>Black Friday Shopping Top Tips</h2>



<p>At Fonehouse, you know we love a deal, so we wanted to share our top tips for shopping this Black Friday!</p>



<h2>1. Be Prepared</h2>



<p>When it comes to securing the best deals, being prepared is the only way forward. This means doing your research and deciding exactly what it is you want. Otherwise, you might waste precious shopping time deciding what to purchase. So, have a think about what handset you want to purchase and how much you would like to spend – deciding this ahead of time also allows you to read some reviews and be confident with your choice.</p>



<p>Once you have done this, you can save tabs with the various products you are interested in to save you having to find these to check on the latest deals.</p>



<h2>2. Shop Around</h2>



<p>As part of your research process, it’s important to shop around. This is particularly important as it means you can see what the prices currently are across different sites. Then, when the deals drop you will know which are offering the best deal – as you are aware of the original price.&nbsp; You can then compare the deals across sites and choose the best one. At Fonehouse, we are offering a price promise across various deals so you know you are getting the best price.</p>



<h2>3. Follow Retailers on Social Media</h2>



<p>Black Friday and sale teasers are big on social media. So, by following your favourite brands you can stay up to date on when the sales are going to start, and which items might be included. It is also beneficial to sign up to newsletters as then you are guaranteed not to miss anything! On this point, you should also set up accounts on the sites you might be shopping on – just to make the whole process a lot smoother on the day!</p>



<h2>4. Don’t Shop the Latest Releases</h2>



<p>Whilst we all love the latest handsets, and you may still bag a bargain on some of the latest handset releases you can get some incredible discounts on previous models. For example, with the iPhone 13 release in September we can expect to see lots of great deals on iPhone 12 models.</p>



<h2>5. Start Early</h2>



<p>Long gone are the days when Black Friday was only one day – it now can span up to a month. Which is fantastic news for deal hunters. People often worry that they have to wait for Black Friday itself to get the best deals but in most cases the deals aren’t any better on the day than they are in the lead up. This year especially, with increased demand and HGV driver concerns, you want to get in there early and be prepared.</p>



<p>With all that in mind, we hope you enjoy your Black Friday sale shopping and manage to get some great deals on the handsets you are looking for. Can’t wait? Check out our <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-offers">latest deals here</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each year sees plenty of new releases, some more highly anticipated than others. 2021 is no different – this year we have already seen a breadth of fun and exciting new phones released onto the market. Including the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g\">Samsung Galaxy S21</a>, <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-5g\">S21 Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-5g\">S21 Ultra</a>. And it is not stopping there – we are still expecting to see some more big releases from the likes of Samsung, Sony, Xiaomi, Nokia, and OnePlus just to name a few.</p>
<p>Of course, we can’t discuss the most anticipated phone releases of the year without mentioning Apple’s eagerly awaited announcement on the next iPhone – but aside from that we have some other rumoured releases that we think are quite exciting as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>The New iPhone</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each year, the Apple iPhone release tends to be the most highly anticipated – and this year is no different. As always, we’re all expecting this release in September and the rumour mill is already churning as to what we might expect from Apple this time around.</p>
<p>Whilst nothing is confirmed, it has been reported by sites such as <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-13-2021\">TechRadar</a>, that the new iPhone won’t differ too much in design from its predecessor – the iPhone 12. However, we’re sure there will be plenty of new, exciting upgrades to the current specification and we’re looking forward to finding out more. Like the ones before it, rumours say that there will be plenty of options when it comes to the variants of the handsets – such as the “mini” and “Pro” versions.</p>
<ol start=\"2\">
<li>
<h2>The New Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Range</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At Fonehouse, we can appreciate something a little bit weird but wonderful. And, that is exactly what we’re expecting from the New Samsung Galaxy Fold Handset. Following on from the release of the Z Fold 2 in 2020, this new release from Samsung is going to continue building on the relatively new success of the foldable phone.</p>
<p>Still in their early days, foldable phones have a way to go – so over the next few years we would expect improvements in things such as durability, size, and weight to ensure these phones get lighter and thinner as they develop.</p>
<ol start=\"3\">
<li>
<h2><strong>Huawei P50 </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Always the innovators, Huawei’s latest release is expected to top their last in terms of design and specification. Things that are rumoured to be improved in Huawei P50 are the camera and hardware. We’re expecting big things from the camera in this phone – with Huawei consistently topping the market when it comes to camera quality.</p>
<p>The only downfall might be the software – Huawei currently do not have access to Google apps or the Google Play Store, which can hamper the experience in terms of software. However, more than likely Huawei developed Apps will run through “Huawei Petal Search” from Launch.  We are hopeful that this will change in time, however, so we are excited to see this next release from Huawei – and, it will be sooner than you think with the Chinese launch set for the end of July.</p>
<ol start=\"4\">
<li>
<h2><strong>The New Samsung Galaxy Fan Edition Range</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first of the FE series was launched by Samsung in 2020 and means ‘fan edition’. This range of the Samsung Galaxy is therefore supposed to encompass everything that the Galaxy S fans want and love about their phones – but at a reasonable price and Samsung has not included all the more ‘premium’ features of the mainstream Galaxy S series.</p>
<p>Back for 2021 with the second in the series, the new version of the FE is expected to launch in August alongside other new products. It is expected to take some influence in terms of design from the Galaxy S21, but with some slight difference in appearance. It will be pretty similar in terms of specification but do expect it to cost a little less than the S21, as with its predecessor.</p>
<ol start=\"5\">
<li>
<h2><strong>OnePlus 9T</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Following the release of the OnePlus 9, we are expecting a further release from the company this year – the OnePlus 9T. Rather than a completely new phone – we are expecting the 9T to be an upgraded version of its predecessor.</p>
<p>There isn’t much known about this phone yet – but we are hoping to see this release later in the year towards the autumn/winter.</p>
<p>We hope you are as excited about these new releases as we are, whilst we only know rumours at this stage – there are definitely rumours to get excited about. And if you really can’t wait, you can take a look at our <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/cheapest-total-cost-mobiles\">current deals</a>.</p>
