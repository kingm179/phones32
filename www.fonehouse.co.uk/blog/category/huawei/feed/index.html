										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s been an ongoing argument as to when children should get their first phone, whatever your opinion, these are the best phones for kids. Just like when you get your first car, you’re bound to damage your first phone. That’s why a lot of parents prefer to buy something slightly cheaper whilst their kids are learning to deal with phones as they should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy A71</h2>
<p>As a rather new release, the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-a71\">Samsung Galaxy A71</a> brings some of the latest features at a much more affordable price. There are two different variants, one being 5G compatible whilst the other isn’t. We’ve included this in our list for the best phones for kids as it’s extremely affordable for what you get. To keep the phone safe, the display is designed with Corning Gorilla Glass 3. This will make smashing the screen that much less likely. Of course, we would also recommend a screen protector for that extra bit of protection.</p>
<p>This device is also top of the list due to the design. With a plastic back, you don’t have to worry about it smashing. That being said, you also get a pretty attractive finish. With a geometric finish when the light hits, your child is bound to fall in love with this. They’ll also have a choice between Prism Crush Black, Prism Crush Silver, Prism Crush Blue and Prism Crush Pink. Having this many colour options allows them to really add their own style to the device, which is sure to make them look after it even more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Apple iPhone 7</h2>
<p>If you were to ask your child what phone they would like, the most likely answer to come out their mouth will be the newest iPhone. Of course, iPhone’s carry quite the price tag. As new phones are released, old phones drop in price. Released in 2016, the iPhone 7 sits at an extremely affordable price with monthly costs being in the teens. With cashback deals, you can reduce these prices to even lower. Not to mention, with the networks available at Fonehouse, you may even be able to use a few extras for yourself.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-7\">Apple iPhone 7</a>, you get all the most important features in one place. As this phone still has a home button, your child can enjoy fingerprint access to their phone. This makes the phone slightly more exciting as it would be should it only have passcode access. They’ll also get access to iOS, which is one of the friendliest operating systems around. This means that should they be struggling to do something, it’s more than likely that you’ll be able to figure it out for them. There are so many different things your child is going to love, apart from the fact they’ll have an iPhone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Huawei P30 Lite</h2>
<p>Of course, we have to cover off at least one smartphone from each of the top three manufacturers. Huawei produces a huge amount of handsets, all being great for children in their own way. In 2019, we were given the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/huawei-p30-lite\">Huawei P30 Lite</a>, which is one of their lower specification phones. Of course, this also makes it cheaper. With extremely high tech features, you child will love this phone. A huge thing they’ll appreciate is the speeds this phone can give out. When they’re playing games, talking to their friends or watching YouTube videos, they’ll be able to do so without interruptions.</p>
<p>Kids love to express themselves through their smartphones nowadays. A great way of them doing this is by taking photos. Lucky for parents, the Huawei P30 Lite doesn’t only have an amazing price, but also an outstanding camera. On the back of the phone is a triple camera consisting of a 48MP main camera, 8MP ultra wide lens and a 2MP depth sensor. Each of these additions to the camera system will allow them to capture photos in the highest quality with great amounts of detail and life like photos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>iPhone SE</h2>
<p>When we say the iPhone SE is one of the best phones for kids, we mean the up to date one. In 2019, Apple released a new and improved iPhone SE, which holds all the best of the old SE and all the best of modern technology. This is the perfect iPhone for your kids if you’re willing to pay a little more, but not break the bank. Reintroducing a smaller screen means the phone’s far smaller too. With a smaller device, you don’t have to worry about it falling out of pockets or even not fitting into pockets!</p>
<p>A huge perk of the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-se\">iPhone SE</a> is the A13 Bionic chipset acting as the brains of the phone. This component is actually the fastest chipset in a smartphone. You can also find the A13 in the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, showing just how high quality it really is. Thanks to this chip, your child can experience the smoothest uploads and downloads, uninterrupted browsing and even buffer free videos. This chip also works to make sure the battery keeping the iPhone SE stays efficient so you don’t have to worry about a dead phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Best Phones for Kids</h2>
<p>When it comes down to really deciding on the best phones for kids, it comes down to what your child needs and what you can afford. If you can’t fork out for the latest technology, then don’t. Children love the novelty of a smartphone and introducing them to modern technology at the top end will just keep up their expectations. You can find plenty of devices that are super budget friendly but have most modern features. Of course, if you can afford something top end and expensive, then there are plenty of options for you to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst these are the best phones for kids in our opinion, there are thousands of other additions you can choose. From huge brands to lesser known manufacturers, there really is something for everyone. You can even find pretty high tech devices at a super affordable price.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each year, we see an influx of smartphone releases. Here’s an introduction to the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/huawei-p40-lite\">Huawei P40 Lite</a>, the most recent budget smartphone from these tech giants. The best thing about this new range of smartphones from Huawei is the features you get to experience. Even in their budget smartphones, you get to experience the best technology. There’s really no reason to lose quality to suit your budget.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Introducing the top features</h2>
<p>All the features hidden away in this smartphone make it seriously amazing and worth far more than you’re paying for. One huge thing that lifts this smartphone above many others is the 4200mAh battery. On a single charge, you’ll be able to use your phone all day long without the worry of losing charge. There are times when we all forget to charge and need a quick boost. For that reason, Huawei have made the P40 Lite compatible with fast charging. If you need a quick boost, sit down, have a coffee and your phone will be ready to go.</p>
<p>Design is something that we all take incredibly seriously. No one wants a phone that doesn’t look or feel nice as they cost a fair amount of our budgets. Huawei has taken this into account. There are two different colour options when purchasing the Huawei P40 Lite. For a more laid back design, you can choose the Midnight Black option. If you want to add a bit of fun to your phone, the Crush Green option is perfect. Both variants catch the light, offering a second hue, creating some depth on the back of the phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Meet the Huawei P40 Lite Camera</h2>
<p>It’s safe to say that the camera found on this budget smartphone is one of the best. We usually see a smaller camera set up with a few less features on lower tier handsets. That’s not the case when it comes down to the Huawei P40 Lite. Featured on the back of the phone, you’ll find a quad lens camera. This consists of a 48MP main lens, 8MP ultrawide lens, 2MP bokeh lens and a 2MP macro lens. Each of these lenses play a huge part in creating super high quality images full of detail.</p>
<p>Most photos will be taken using the 48MP lens. Alone, this is going to create some high resolution photographs with cinematic detail. This lens is mixed with AI ultra clarity mode, making sure multiple different frames blend together to give you high quality images. You will also find this lens holds a night sensor. When in low light situations, you’ll still be able to capture high quality images. Allowing you to capture the world in full is the ultrawide lens. This will let you capture more of the world in a single frame. This is also great for capturing photos of your loved ones without having to squeeze in.</p>
<p>The last two lenses in the Huawei P40 Lite camera setup allow you to get really artistic and produce some professional photographs. If you want to get up close and personal with your photo subject, the 2MP macro lens is your perfect addition. Enjoy shooting from as close as 4cm to find colours and details you didn’t even know were there. The final lens is the depth lens. This allows your photos to stand out against the others. Using AI perception, the subject of your photo will pop against the background.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Best P40 Lite Deals</h2>
<p>When searching through Fonehouse deals, you’ll find three different networks, EE, Vodafone and Three. We choose to work with each of these networks to ensure each customer received an A* service. When you join EE, the UKs best network, you’ll get to experience the best network speeds and network coverage in the UK. You will also get to make use of the exclusive entertainment packages, available to all EE customers. This gives you access to multiple different free trial subscriptions with huge brands, such as BritBox and BT Sports Mobile. Joining EE will keep you entertained with no interruptions from all points of the UK.</p>
<p>When you join Three, the benefits are slightly different to those found on other networks. Three offer Go Roam and Go Binge across different plans. Every customer will have access to Go Roam. This lets you use your pay monthly allowance in 71 different destinations. You don’t have to worry about incurring any nasty roaming charges. If you have joined with a plan including 12GB or more, you’ll be able to use the Go Binge feature. This allows you to stream from huge platforms without eating into your data. Three work with apps such as Netflix and Snapchat to bring this.</p>
<p>Finally, Vodafone benefits vary massively. There are two different benefits. If you are on a Vodafone Red Entertainment package, you’ll have access to their subscription package. This allows you to enjoy a subscription throughout your entire contract. These are with the likes of Spotify and Sky Sports. Any Vodafone customer will be able to enjoy VeryMe Rewards. This is accessible through the Vodafone app. Each week, you’ll find a new range of discounts and giveaways with all your favourite brands. You may even discover a few new brands that you’ll start to love.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don’t think the Huawei P40 Lite is quite for you, there is a huge range of other <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/huawei-mobile-phone-deals\">Huawei handsets</a> so you can find the perfect one for you. When it comes to Huawei, there’s a smartphone for everyone.</p>
