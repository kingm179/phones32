										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-8\">iPhone 8</a> was the last of the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals\">iPhones</a> to feature the iconic middle button and was also the first series to bring you wireless charging, so we are not surprised it is still one of the most popular choices when it comes to bagging a new phone. Here are some great tips and tricks for getting the best out of your iPhone 8.</span></p>
<h2><b>Single-Handed Operation </b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find yourself using your phone with one hand, but struggling to reach the whole keyboard without having to overstretch or reach for the other hand, then this is a really nifty tip. You can move the keyboard over to one side or the other, depending on which hand you are using, and it suddenly becomes a piece of cake to single-handedly operate your handset. To set the keyboard press and hold the emoji icon button and you will see three options appear, centre, left or right. Just choose the one you prefer and off you go!</span></p>
<h2><b>Wireless Charging</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we already mentioned, this is a phone with wireless charging capabilities. As yet manufacturers do not give away wireless chargers with handsets, you will still get the lightning cable in the box. The cable tends to charge slightly faster anyway but do have a play with the wireless charging if you get the chance. Any QI compatible charger will work, and when this article was written, Apple had not got around to releasing their own. Of course, there is also wireless charging furniture available in certain stores now, IKEA being one of the leading lights. You can get chargers that resemble stands so you can see the screen easily or flat pads for popping on the side. </span></p>
<h2><b>Discover AR</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Augmented reality is a newer offering from Apple, and it is loads of fun. Thankfully the iPhone 8 has been optimised and comes equipped with the hardware needed, in the form of the A11 Bionic chip. You will find that there are some Apple apps, like the tape measure, and plenty of other cool apps in the App Store, that you can use here. IKEA (at the forefront once again) has cool AR apps, and for younger kids, Thomas the Tank Engine and friends can make an appearance in the room. Many games now feature AR modes, so there really is plenty to do. Gone are the days of Pokemon Go being the only augmented reality game out there. It is spreading like wildfire. </span></p>
<h2><b>Prepare for an Emergency </b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this might sound a little depressing, it is a good thing to do. The iPhone 8 comes with both medical information and emergency SOS. Set up your medical data, which gives you peace of mind that vital information can be passed on if needed and get emergency SOS working. Go to your settings and switch on the feature. Now when you tap the home button five times in a row, the emergency contacts can be called, but the rest of your phone is protected and locked away.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">It is fast approaching that time again when Amazon will be offering their amazing prime day deals, and amongst the offers for inflatable unicorns and discounted bath mats, there will be a huge number of tech deals, and this will include deals on <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals\">mobile phones</a>. Generally, these tend to focus around <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/os/android-mobile-phone-deals\">Android phones</a>, and there have been a few choice deals that have appeared previously, so it is a good idea to keep an eye out.</span></p>
<h2><b>What to Watch For?</b></h2>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">When it comes to prime day, what you need to be aware is that new deals come online all throughout the day, and they only stay available until they are sold out, or an hour passes, whichever is soonest. Prime day starts at midnight on 15</span><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">th&nbsp;</span><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">July this year, but the majority of great deals will appear around peak shopping time, so think the beginning and end of the work day as the best shopping time, along with lunch time. You will need to get in quick if you are going to secure the best deals, so have a look.</span></p>
<h2><b>Finding the Best Prime Day Deal</b></h2>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">One of the ways you can improve your odds of getting a good mobile deal on prime day is took have a look at what deals are going on at the moment. This will also give you time to do a bit of research into the phones as well, and see what you get for your money, and/or whether the deal is worth it. The chances are that a number of the prime day deals will be enhancements of existing deals on mobile phones, so if you find something that looks to be a good deal today, then on prime day it may be even more lucrative. So make sure you know what it is that you are after.</span></p>
<h2><b>Handsets to Look For</b></h2>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">When it comes to the mobile deals on Amazon Prime Day, what you should expect is that it is unlikely to be the latest and greatest, newest handsets that are going to be given the best deals. What you might want to look for is phones where there has recently been a newer model released. The chances are that the older models are going to be the ones that have deals on them as Amazon looks to shift old stock to make way for the newer ones. This is great if you want a deal and you don’t need to have the cutting edge of the market.</span></p>
<h2><strong>B</strong><b>rands to Watch For</b></h2>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">When it comes to mobile deals on Prime Day, you will see some of the biggest and best deals with some of the more independent brands. A couple of Prime Days ago, the ‘WileyFox’ android mobile had an amazing prime day deal, and this was actually one of the best independent Android handsets on the market, and had a very high spec for the price. You are more likely to find deals of this type than on the latest and greatest of the big names.</span></p>
