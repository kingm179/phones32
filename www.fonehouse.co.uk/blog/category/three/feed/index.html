<p>It’s back!&nbsp; The Fonehouse price promise, is returning this February.&nbsp; A Fonehouse crowd favourite from our last Black Friday sale, and for a limited time we are bringing it back to you.</p>



<p>Throughout February, you can be sure to get the very best deal against 8 of the largest mobile phone retailers and resellers. Including Mobile Phones Direct, Carphone Warehouse, Vodafone Direct, Three Direct, Buymobiles, Affordable Mobiles, ChitterChatter, Mobiles.co.uk.</p>



<p>Meaning you can switch and fix a new deal for yourself this February and save some much-needed cashola. <strong>Take that energy price hikes!</strong></p>



<p>Our <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-offers">February mobile deals and price match</a> are offered across all your favourite devices. Including the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">iPhone 13 range</a>, <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsung S21 range</a> alongside budget and entry level devices starting from just £14 / month.</p>



<p>We are price matching daily, so if you see a great deal today, be sure to take advantage as it may not be there tomorrow!</p>



<p>This offer will only last until the end of February. With deals this low, you’d be mad not to upgrade your mobile now to the latest handset covered under our price match. For further details see our <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-offers">mobile phone offers</a>.</p>



<h3 id="join-our-campaign-this-february-to-switch-and-fix-a-great-deal"><strong>Join our campaign this February, to &#8220;Switch and Fix&#8221; a great deal</strong></h3>



<p>Fonehouse has launched a new campaign to help our customers save money. With the ever-increasing costs from everything to food and energy, isn’t it time to save money on your next mobile contract?</p>



<p>If you are coming out of a contract elsewhere, you might be able to save a bundle by switching to a new network and tariff through Fonehouse. Martin Lewis recently highlighted the savings people can make on their <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2022/01/-martin-lewis--paying-more-than-p10-mth-on-your-phone-bill--if-s/">monthly mobile bills</a>.</p>



<p>You too can save if you opt for a SIM only deal through Fonehouse. Although Martin highlighted how <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/best-sim-only-deals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheap SIM plans</a> can go, you’d also best to think about the real data needs you have with you mobile phone. Opting for a cheap 1GB plan will likely leave you at a loss each month when you run out of data.</p>



<p>Fonehouse offers 50GB, 100GB and Unlimited plans to leave you covered for every type of need you can think of. Starting from just £12/month on Vodafone, with 50GB of monthly refresh data and £45 automatic cashback on top (making the monthly line rental effectively £10.13/month) can save you a bundle if you want to keep your same handset.</p>



<p>Or if you can stretch your budget a bit further you can likely save a whole load of cashola from what you pay now by opting for a new contract with a new device and nothing upfront. Take for example the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-5g">Samsung Galaxy S20 FE with 5G</a>, less than 1 year since launch and you can get a 30GB/month data tariff for just £27/month over 24 months. In the UK, the average monthly tariff is around £37/month so that saves you over £240 across 2 years vs. what people pay on average.</p>



<p>Our team can also help you find a way to save this February. You can call our UK customer service team on 0333 900 1133. We are open until 8pm Monday to Thursday, 6pm Fridays and 5.30pm on Saturdays.</p>
