<p><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/google-mobile-phone-deals">Google</a> are known for producing high-performing handsets which are full of speed, power and intelligent photography ability, and with their highly anticipated <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/google-pixel-6a-5g">Google Pixel 6a 5G</a> model going live for preorder on the 21st of July, the Pixel family is finally growing. Here is all the magic this 5G handset has to offer:</p>



<h2>Google Pixel 6a: All Day Power</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10572" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-150x84.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-300x169.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-768x432.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One of the worst things that can happen to any modern-day smartphone user is their phone inconveniently dying midway through the day, with not a charger in sight…. (a complete horror story we know). Well with the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/google-pixel-6a-5g">Google Pixel 6a’s</a> 4410 mAh long-lasting battery this won&#8217;t ever be an issue. Users are supplied with much-needed all-day power (24 hours+) and with the Extreme Battery Saver mode turned on, can even extend their battery life for up to 72 hours total. When you do in fact have to plug in and charge your device, this experience will be quick thanks to fast wired 18W charging. This is a smartphone that wants you to get up and go!</p>



<h2>Google Pixel 6a Design &amp; Display</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10571" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-150x84.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-300x169.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-768x432.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Looks aren’t everything but the design of the Google Pixel 6a 5G is pretty impressive. With 3 different colours up for grabs: Sage, Chalk and Charcoal, paired with a beautifully sleek exterior with rounded edges, no matter what colour option people go for they will be wowed. Also, the large 6.1” FHD+ OLED display featured on the device only adds to the premium aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Google Pixel 6a Camera</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10583" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-150x84.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Lights, camera, action. It’s time for the juicy details about the camera included on this flagship handset. The rear of this device features a dual-lens set-up, consisting of a 12.2MP wide lens and a 12MP ultrawide lens. These lenses and added features like Face Unblur work effortlessly together to give users stable and blur-free shots. Magic Eraser gives users the ability to remove unwanted objects from images, and Real Tone captures the authenticity of all skin tones! All these cool features mentioned are Pixel Exclusives, so they’re completely one of a kind. Side note the selfie camera on this device is 8MP so it’s also great at giving you picture-perfect photos.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of everyone’s favourite thing about Apple’s recent releases is the Memoji but how do you make custom emojis on an Android? There is actually a way and it’s worth trying it out.</p>
<p>This feature is something that has recently been bought to <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/os/android-mobile-phone-deals\">Android</a> that allows you to edit two emojis together to create some super cool new emojis. Mixing your favourite emojis is pretty cool and can show some serious emotions in your messages. The exciting addition to Android phones is called Emoji Kitchen. You can’t yet mix all emojis but this is in the works.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What do you need?</h2>
<p>As this is a Google app, you can only make use of it if you have an Android phone. Currently, Google is only testing the Emoji Kitchen feature so you do need to <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.google.android.inputmethod.latin\">register to become a tester</a> and download the app. The feature is only in testing stages so not every app you have will be compatible with these new emoji creations. Major apps are working with the new add ons, such as Facebook and lots of Google apps. If Emoji Kitchen goes down well with it’s testers, we may see more and more app updates to ensure they are compatible with it.</p>
<p>Once you have registered, you’ll have a list of instructions as to how to get your hands on the app. All you need to do is follow the relevant links and set it all up. You’ll find a link taking you through to the Google Play Store where you can download the Gboard. If you already have the Gboard installed, you will need to update it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How do you create the emoji?</h2>
<p>Now for the fun parts! How do you make customer emojis on an Android? Look no further! We’re about to get into how we actually do this.</p>
<p>All you need to do is open up your Gboard to access these emoji creations. Tap through to the little blue face on right near the space bar. You should see an instruction with ‘tap an emoji to get suggestions’ appear. Simply pick an emoji and all mashups available will appear. Each emoji that is included in the feature will have a list of combinations so make sure you have a good look around!</p>
<p>There are quite a few emojis that aren’t compatible with this mix up as of yet however, Google is bound to extend the range of emojis used. Currently, you can get different combinations from most regular faces however, not too many other than that.</p>
<p>Sending your fun new creation is just like sending any other text. Once you’ve made up your mind on the perfect smiley, click this and it will appear in your text box.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>You won’t be able to send these versions of emojis through apps that aren’t compatible as of yet. You can have a play around on different apps to find out exactly what apps are compatible but an iPhone will not support this!</p>
