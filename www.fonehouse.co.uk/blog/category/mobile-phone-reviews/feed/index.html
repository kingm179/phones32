<p>The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/sony-xperia-10-iv-5g-128gb-black">Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G</a> has been labelled as the “perfect companion for everyday life”. You might be wondering what exactly does that mean? Well, in this new handsets case, this means a long-lasting 5,000mAh battery great for long days of adventure, a 6.0” illuminating OLED display destined for streaming perfection, High-Resolution Audio for a concert-like listening experience and so much more. I put these claims to the test by taking this shiny new handset with me on a London day out (a very long one at that). Will this lightweight <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/sony-mobile-phone-deals">Sony</a> handset live up to the hype? Keep scrolling to find out.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1: 6.0” 21:9 Wide OLED Display&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>We all want a display that injects life into everything we do on our devices, whether that’s endless social media scrolling, streaming your favourite guilty pleasure TV show or even engaging in some quality gaming time. The 6.0” Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G display has a lot of cool features under its belt. To name a few a 21:9 FHD+ OLED TRILUMINOS Display for breathtaking colour and contrast and a 2520 x 1080 resolution for crystal clear visuals.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1:  Display Test </strong></h2>



<p>If you’re a film fanatic you’re probably used to heading to the likes of Youtube to check out the latest trailers that are fresh on the scene and to test the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G display I did just that. This time I watched the Woman Is King Trailer- a highly anticipated film due to be released in October 2022.</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1: Result&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-full"><img width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10542" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As soon as I hit play I was blown away by the magic the TRILUMINOS® display the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G had to offer. The truest golds, deepest greens and boldest purples were showcased and the large 6”0 screen size only added to the experience further. There is a reason why Sony are known for their expertise in remarkable displays. The handset also fitted comfortably in hand due to its compact design and super lightweight feel.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Triple Lens Rear Camera&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>An exceptional camera is a requirement for the majority of modern-day smartphone users (I mean how else will we snap all of our wonderful Instagram content?). This Sony device&#8217;s triple rear camera has been described as “feature-packed” and “breathtaking”. This camera set-up consists of a 16mm 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, a 27mm 12MP wide-angle lens and lastly a 54mm 8MP telephoto lens.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Camera Test</strong></h2>



<p>Since I spent the weekend exploring all the magic London has to offer from views to food, I thought this was the perfect opportunity to use the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G to capture it in all its glory.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Result</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gDJuObLpaV_9irrw2Do6nLAri7C2dHJqcEnwM5moUuC_2qDPq6ZrTME2VDvCdI1rlMy_ninlHb9yscbq_qtO_5uGZLxvzXkKxDwIdBa3K__eS-txTbKyeHxYmFl4814DZ0M9EkgLybUxSpw_iBXlwew" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Brick Lane in East London was my first stop, where I was hit with a beautiful range of colourful street art and graffiti which I just had to snap some photos of. The Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G effortlessly picked up all the vibrancy and light within the shot thanks to the trio of lenses and incredible LED flash. If posting art across your social media platforms is your thing, this is the perfect camera for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My second stop with the Sony Xperia by my side was the South African restaurant Shaka Zulu in Camden Market. Thanks to Optical Image Stabilisation, Night Mode and Auto HDR, my photos were blur-free, stable and clear despite the restaurant&#8217;s very low lighting conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the beautiful colours of the dishes were picked up at exceptional quality, and again the incredible LED flash illuminated the shot efficiently. A photo so good you can almost taste it. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10537" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-150x113.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1.jpg 1249w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2><strong>Feature 3: Powerful 5,000mAh Battery For All Day Power&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>A long-lasting battery is essential for any long day out, I mean there’s music to be played, photos to be taken and videos to be streamed. Thankfully the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G is equipt with a large capacity 5,000mAh battery giving users much-needed ‘all-day power’.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3: Battery Test </strong></h2>



<p>Leaving my house at 11 AM with the Sony handset by my side, and not getting back home until 11 PM that night, gave this handset a solid 12 hours test to see if the claim of ‘all-day power’ had some proof behind it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3: Result</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="447" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-1024x447.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10544" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-150x65.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-300x131.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-768x335.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-1024x447.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-1536x670.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-2048x894.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Starting on a 100% charge and after 12 hours of photo-taking, bursts of gaming and music-playing, the Xperia device&#8217;s 5,000mAh battery only dropped by 12% &#8211; not bad at all for a full day&#8217;s work. Life with this smartphone means using a power bank won&#8217;t be a regular occurrence at all. Looks like the ‘All Day Power’ statement has proof in the pudding after all.</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 4: Premium Sound&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Sony and premium sound come hand in hand. For a truly authentic listening experience, the 10 IV 5G is equipt with High-Resolution Audio (which gives you premium sound), 360 Reality Audio Upmix (which works with local audio files and streaming services to further enhance your listening experience) and a 3.5mm audio jack (perfect for on the go streaming).&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 4:  Sound Test </strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" data-id="10543"  src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10543" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-80x80.jpg 80w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</figure>



<p>As a music lover, I was excited to test out the audio quality on this device. The golden question was would the experience be mini-concert worthy and premium? To answer this burning question I headed to Spotify, pressed a feel-good song and listened away.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 4: Result</strong></h2>



<p>The audio quality from this handset was one of a kind. The 360 Reality Upmix feature in particular created an immersive experience in real-time. Achieving premium quality sound on this device is done with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately I found the 10 IV 5G very impressive. Not only were the acclaimed stand-out features regarding the display, camera, sound and battery true, but they actually exceeded my expectations. </p>



<p>After hearing all the wonderful things the<a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/sony-xperia-10-iv-5g-128gb-black"> Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G</a> has to offer I&#8217;m sure you’re eager to get your hands on a device of your own.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have just got your latest and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals\">Samsung Mobile Phone</a>, and now you want to know how to get the best of it. What better than installing some killer apps for it, and these are some of the best that you should download to make the most of your <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus\">S10 Plus.</a></p>
<h2><b>Hidey Hole</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loving the new infinity display, but thinking that the punch holes are ruining it a little, then this is the app for you. This app provides you with a curated list of wallpapers that are designed with the punch holes in mind, and are designed to hide them easily within the design. This means that despite them still being there, you no longer notice them.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This app is constantly updated so you will always find something good to choose from.</span></p>
<h2><b>Holey Light</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things that having an infinity display does is eliminates the notification LED. Which some people are missing as a quick visual indicator as to what is going on. If you are one of those people then this is for you. What the app does is change the colour of the edge of the punch hole camera to pulse with different colours depending on the notifications. This effectively gives you a notification led, but makes use of the punch hole camera to do so.</span></p>
<h2><b>Battery Ring</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is yet another app that does something different with the punch hole in the display for the camera. This time, it lights up partially around the edge as a visual indicator of how much battery life is left on your phone. With tones of customisation options for colours etc, this a great visual indicator of when you need to charge your phone, or when it is done charging on your bedside table.</span></p>
<h2><b>Borderlight</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one isn’t about the punch hole thankfully, but instead what this does is give your entire phone a colourful changing border around your screens edge. Think of it as a more colourful replacement to the edge lighting feature that is found on the phone. This gives a great effect and is in keeping with the current trend in accessories on gaming devices, so maybe this just one for the games in the audience.</span></p>
<h2><b>Sound Assistant</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is unique in that it is an app directly from Samsung, and once installed on your phone it allows you more granular control over how your sound works. It allows you to adjust the sound volume for apps individually as well as change what the volume buttons control, be it media, or call volumes. This is an app that should have been there by default, but as such it is a nice addition.</span></p>
<h2><b>AdHell3</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AdHell3 is one of those useful apps that blocks ads system wide on the phone, it runs as a service in the background, doesn’t require root, and it doesn’t drain your battery, which is fantastic and something that really gives you great control over your phone and saves your data.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s9\">The Galaxy S9’s</a> camera so a leap ahead in terms of the technology. It features a number of innovations, that mean that your photos really pop, and shine in the right light.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Basics</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the S9 you get a single lens, dual aperture rear camera. It is a 12-megapixel wide angle lens and has f/1.5 and f/2.4 variable apertures. This also has an auto-focus lens. It is also capable of capturing video in full 4K UHD at 60 fps, and you also get the super slow-motion video capture mode, this will take video at 960 fps. On the front there is an 8-megapixel camera that is great for taking selfies, and also makes your video calls look really great.</span></p>
<h2><b>Performance</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dual aperture aspect of the lens is designed to improve performance of the camera in low light levels. The selective focus mode uses the dual aperture to bring attention to the object of your picture, whilst blurring out the background. This is a really clever trick, and the dual aperture means that in low light levels you can still get really good results and take great pictures without using the flash.</span></p>
<h2><b>Low Light</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low light has been the focus by Samsung when it came to the camera this time. They wanted to make sure that when you take a photo, that it doesn’t appear washed out or over exposed. Whilst the camera uses automatic settings by default. You can change these manually to ensure that you get the best photo. This includes selecting which aperture to use. You can also switch the phone into Pro mode, and this gives you manual settings for every option. This requires some experimentation, but you can get some great results. The use of HDR also makes sure that the darkest areas of your phone really pops.</span></p>
<h2><b>Photo Software</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of great features included in the camera software, that lets you do many different things. There is an option called AR Emoji, and what this does is use your image to create a number of cartoon animated gifs that you can send to your friends instead of regular emojis. The camera software itself it set up to run everything automatically by default, and this means that most of the time you get the best possible pictures. It includes choosing which aperture to use, and it seamlessly switches between the two depending on the shot. If you find this a little over zealous, then you can use the Pro Mode to override it.</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The camera has been greatly improved on the Galaxy S8 and it is so much better than the one on the Galaxy S8. You can spend hours and hours playing with all the different options and changing the settings, whilst you get a load of really good photos. So, whether you are trying to get into photography, or just want to up your selfie game and become the envy of social media. The options are there for you.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-8\">iPhone 8</a> was the last of the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals\">iPhones</a> to feature the iconic middle button and was also the first series to bring you wireless charging, so we are not surprised it is still one of the most popular choices when it comes to bagging a new phone. Here are some great tips and tricks for getting the best out of your iPhone 8.</span></p>
<h2><b>Single-Handed Operation </b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you find yourself using your phone with one hand, but struggling to reach the whole keyboard without having to overstretch or reach for the other hand, then this is a really nifty tip. You can move the keyboard over to one side or the other, depending on which hand you are using, and it suddenly becomes a piece of cake to single-handedly operate your handset. To set the keyboard press and hold the emoji icon button and you will see three options appear, centre, left or right. Just choose the one you prefer and off you go!</span></p>
<h2><b>Wireless Charging</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As we already mentioned, this is a phone with wireless charging capabilities. As yet manufacturers do not give away wireless chargers with handsets, you will still get the lightning cable in the box. The cable tends to charge slightly faster anyway but do have a play with the wireless charging if you get the chance. Any QI compatible charger will work, and when this article was written, Apple had not got around to releasing their own. Of course, there is also wireless charging furniture available in certain stores now, IKEA being one of the leading lights. You can get chargers that resemble stands so you can see the screen easily or flat pads for popping on the side. </span></p>
<h2><b>Discover AR</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Augmented reality is a newer offering from Apple, and it is loads of fun. Thankfully the iPhone 8 has been optimised and comes equipped with the hardware needed, in the form of the A11 Bionic chip. You will find that there are some Apple apps, like the tape measure, and plenty of other cool apps in the App Store, that you can use here. IKEA (at the forefront once again) has cool AR apps, and for younger kids, Thomas the Tank Engine and friends can make an appearance in the room. Many games now feature AR modes, so there really is plenty to do. Gone are the days of Pokemon Go being the only augmented reality game out there. It is spreading like wildfire. </span></p>
<h2><b>Prepare for an Emergency </b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this might sound a little depressing, it is a good thing to do. The iPhone 8 comes with both medical information and emergency SOS. Set up your medical data, which gives you peace of mind that vital information can be passed on if needed and get emergency SOS working. Go to your settings and switch on the feature. Now when you tap the home button five times in a row, the emergency contacts can be called, but the rest of your phone is protected and locked away.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals\">Apple</a> makes some of the best technology around. There\&#8217;s a good reason that they are one of the top three designers and providers in the mobile phone industry. Getting an iPhone for yourself is an aspiration of many. <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-6s\">The iPhone 6s</a> is known to be an excellent choice, offering a lot of features despite being an older model. </span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things you might know about Apple products is that they can customise both the Lock Screen, which is the screen you first see when you use the phone and the Home Screen, which is the background of the phone when it\&#8217;s in use.  We\&#8217;re going to show you how to change both of those right now. </span></p>
<h2><b>Changing Your Wallpapers</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First things first. You’re going to need to have a wallpaper ready to use. That’s not difficult to find &#8211; either take a photo that you want to use or go into the internet and find something that takes your fancy. Remember to make sure that you search for photos that work with the screen size of your phone. You can make sure you get the right dimensions by specifying “iPhone 6S” in the search results. </span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now that you’ve done that, you’re ready to go and change the wallpaper for your mobile device. A lot of people have two different photos or images on hand &#8211; one for their lock screen and then one for their home screen. Changing the designs on your phone is easy. You’ll want to open the settings app and find the wallpaper function. </span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve done that, click follow the instructions to change your wallpaper. You can select one of the preset options, or you can pick out the image that you have chosen. Whatever you go for, you need to make sure that you have adjusted it to suit your specific needs and preferences. Hopefully, you’ve taken the time to get an image that will fit the screen correctly; otherwise, you’re going to have to make some sacrifices. </span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once you’ve got the amount in the shot that you want, you need to make sure that you click save and wait for a second. A notification will flash up and tell you that you have successfully changed the photo, and then either lock the phone or go to your home screen to look at the result. </span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is pretty easy to make sure that you have properly changed your lock screen and home screen. They don’t require a lot of effort to get right and at the same time can look stunning. It doesn’t take a lot of time to sit down and figure out how to change your background, but you’ll be thankful that you did. Thanks to the stunning graphics of the iPhone 6S, you’ve got access to whatever you need in terms of backgrounds and wallpapers, so it becomes a simple task to find something incredible and turn it into your next backdrop.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">It is fast approaching that time again when Amazon will be offering their amazing prime day deals, and amongst the offers for inflatable unicorns and discounted bath mats, there will be a huge number of tech deals, and this will include deals on <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals\">mobile phones</a>. Generally, these tend to focus around <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/os/android-mobile-phone-deals\">Android phones</a>, and there have been a few choice deals that have appeared previously, so it is a good idea to keep an eye out.</span></p>
<h2><b>What to Watch For?</b></h2>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">When it comes to prime day, what you need to be aware is that new deals come online all throughout the day, and they only stay available until they are sold out, or an hour passes, whichever is soonest. Prime day starts at midnight on 15</span><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">th&nbsp;</span><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">July this year, but the majority of great deals will appear around peak shopping time, so think the beginning and end of the work day as the best shopping time, along with lunch time. You will need to get in quick if you are going to secure the best deals, so have a look.</span></p>
<h2><b>Finding the Best Prime Day Deal</b></h2>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">One of the ways you can improve your odds of getting a good mobile deal on prime day is took have a look at what deals are going on at the moment. This will also give you time to do a bit of research into the phones as well, and see what you get for your money, and/or whether the deal is worth it. The chances are that a number of the prime day deals will be enhancements of existing deals on mobile phones, so if you find something that looks to be a good deal today, then on prime day it may be even more lucrative. So make sure you know what it is that you are after.</span></p>
<h2><b>Handsets to Look For</b></h2>
<p><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">When it comes to the mobile deals on Amazon Prime Day, what you should expect is that it is unlikely to be the latest and greatest, newest handsets that are going to be given the best deals. What you might want to look for is phones where there has recently been a newer model released. The chances are that the older models are going to be the ones that have deals on them as Amazon looks to shift old stock to make way for the newer ones. This is great if you want a deal and you don’t need to have the cutting edge of the market.</span></p>
<h2><strong>B</strong><b>rands to Watch For</b></h2>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><span style="\&quot;font-weight:" 400;\"="">When it comes to mobile deals on Prime Day, you will see some of the biggest and best deals with some of the more independent brands. A couple of Prime Days ago, the ‘WileyFox’ android mobile had an amazing prime day deal, and this was actually one of the best independent Android handsets on the market, and had a very high spec for the price. You are more likely to find deals of this type than on the latest and greatest of the big names.</span></p>
