<p>We’re in the digital age where pretty much everyone is signed up for a range of subscriptions. Netflix, Apple Music, EA Play, you name it, I&#8217;m sure you have it all. Although having a wide range of services is great,  going through the process of setting up individual subscriptions one by one can be time-consuming and quite expensive in the long run. What if you could get all the media platforms you need under one subscription instead? Well, <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">Apple </a>One has done just that.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>What Is Apple One?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Apple One combines all the best streaming services Apple has to offer into one easy subscription. Apple One has a range of amazing plans up for grabs that can cater to individual users, or whole families/ groups. The 3 types of plans available are: an Individual plan (£14.95/mo), a Family Plan (£19.95/mo) and a Premier Plan (£29.95/mo).&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the long run, this monthly fee subscription is a huge money-saver and saves you the task of individually setting up your music streaming service, TV streaming service, gaming service and so on. Multiple forms of entertainment under one monthly payment.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Apple One: What’s Included?</strong></h2>



<p>Six wonderful Apple services are available within the Apple One subscription. Each service is as equally as great as the other, and you’re guaranteed to have all your entertainment needs covered. Keep on scrolling to find out which ones in particular you can expect.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Apple Music:</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img width="2560" height="1439" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/auguras-pipiras-OC7Jb9LDIf8-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10306" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/auguras-pipiras-OC7Jb9LDIf8-unsplash-edited-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/auguras-pipiras-OC7Jb9LDIf8-unsplash-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/auguras-pipiras-OC7Jb9LDIf8-unsplash-edited-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/auguras-pipiras-OC7Jb9LDIf8-unsplash-edited-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/auguras-pipiras-OC7Jb9LDIf8-unsplash-edited-1536x863.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/auguras-pipiras-OC7Jb9LDIf8-unsplash-edited-2048x1151.jpg 2048w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/auguras-pipiras-OC7Jb9LDIf8-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>

<p>Apple lovers across the globe eagerly tuned in to Apple&#8217;s live event on the 8th of March, which saw the release of the new <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-se-5G">iPhone SE</a>. The iPhone SE is the newest budget-friendly device on the market for <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>, following their previous 2020 SE release. Now you’re probably wondering, ‘what exactly has changed in the space of two years?’ &#8211; well to answer your question, quite a lot.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5><strong>Colours, Colours, Colours</strong></h5>



<div class="wp-container-1 wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p>The 2020 iPhone SE was released in 3 colour options: Black, White and Red &#8211; pretty standard. The brand spanking new 2022 iPhone SE however is up for grabs in the colours Midnight, Starlight and Red, the shades are the same but the names have been spiced up a bit.<a></a><a></a></p>
</div></div>



<div style="height:19px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5><strong>So What About The Chip?</strong></h5>



<p>You’ve got to love a chip upgrade, The 2020 version of the iPhone SE ran primarily on an A13 Bionic processing chip. At the time this chip was pretty mindblowing for the iPhone SE, as you would’ve gotten the same chip that&#8217;s in the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max. As you probably predicted over the span of two years Apple has conjured up something newer and more powerful than ever: the A15 Bionic Chip- the chip that enhances everything you do. This is the chip that’s installed within the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro and now the 2022 iPhone SE -making the new SE considerably more powerful than the previous model.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="370" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-colours-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9927" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-colours-2-150x79.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-colours-2-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-colours-2.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5><strong>Size &amp; Display</strong></h5>



<p>Sorry…nothing to see here, both the 2020 and the 2022 iPhone SE have the same 4.7-inch pocket-friendly size &#8211; the same as the iPhone 8. Additionally, both the models have the same 1334-by-750-pixel resolution (if it works well why change it?). A great similarity between the devices is the remain of the trustee home button, a feature deeply missed on Apple’s latest releases.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5><a></a><strong>Smile For The Camera</strong></h5>



<p>Although the single rear 12MP lens has remained the same on both the 2020 and the 2022 iPhone SE, it&#8217;s the A15 Bionic chip that really sets the two devices apart. With this swanky new chip, you’ll now have full access to cool camera features like Deep Fusion, Smart HDR, Portrait mode and various other photographic styles &#8211; a door opened. So if you lover of snapping pics, it&#8217;s definitely worth making the switch over to the newer iPhone SE. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="370" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-2022-Camera-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9928" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-2022-Camera-1-150x79.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-2022-Camera-1-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-2022-Camera-1.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>



<h5><strong>A Bump in Battery</strong></h5>



<p>Both the 2020 and the 2022 iPhone SE batteries are fast charging compatible (18W) and enable you to get a 50% charge in just 30 minutes. However, you&#8217;ll be happy to hear there has been a significant increase in playback time in the new device. The 2020 version offered up to 13 hours of video playback, up to 8 hours of streamed video playback and up to 40 hours of audio playback. The 2022 version however offers up to 15 hours of video playback, up to 10 hours of streamed video playback, and up to 50 hours of audio playback &#8211; the newer SE definitely wins the competition on length of usage. More time to do the things you love on your device.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So, you’ve got your new <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g">iPhone 13</a>, you are excited to get started – but how do you actually go about setting it up? Don’t worry we’ve got you covered.</p>



<p>The first step is to unpackage your new phone, which we’re sure you will have done the second you got it! From there you want to turn on the phone and make sure you are setting it up over an internet connection or connected to a computer.</p>



<p>The best thing about iPhones is that if you already have one, or an iPad, you can transfer all of your data easily – and you can even do the same with an Android! Below, we’ll take you through how to do both of these.</p>



<h2>Before iPhone Set Up &nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are a few things you can do before you set up your new phone that can help it go as smoothly as possible. Make sure you have a Wi-Fi connection ready, so it is best to do this at home if you can!</p>



<p>Make sure to have your Apple ID and password to hand, if you don’t have one you can create one – you can also have your credit and debit cards to hand if you want to set up Apple pay at this point too!</p>



<p>If you are transferring from an old iPhone, now is your chance to make sure you have backed it up. If you have an Android, have this to hand.</p>



<p>Now, press and hold the side button until the Apple logo appears. If you have any issues at this point, plug the phone in as it may need charging.</p>



<p>If you are choosing to set up manually, you now have to select this option and the instructions will appear onscreen to guide you through the process. However, if not keep reading.</p>



<h2>How to Set Up a New iPhone Using Quick Start</h2>



<ol type="1"><li>If you have another iPhone, iPad or iPod touch you can get this device and use quick start. Bring the old and new devices together and follow onscreen prompts to copy over your settings, preferences and iCloud.</li><li>If you have iOS 12.4 or below, you’ll have to transfer the rest of your data from an iCloud backup.</li><li>If you have iOS 12.4 and above, this data will be wirelessly transferred from your existing device. Keep the devices together whilst this happens.</li><li>If you have vision impairments, you can triple click the side button to turn on the screen reader.</li></ol>



<h2>How to Set Up an iPhone 13 If You Have an Android</h2>



<p>If you currently have an <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/os/android-mobile-phone-deals">Android device</a>, you can also securely move data from this device to your new iPhone 13.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>On your Android device, download the ‘Move to iOS’ app.</li><li>On your iPhone 13, follow the usual setup steps and select ‘Move Data from Android’ when prompted on the data screen.</li><li>On your Android device, turn on Wi-Fi and open the Move to iOS app – follow the onscreen instructions and your data will be securely transferred.</li></ol>



<p>There you have it! You have set up your brand-new <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g">iPhone 13</a> or <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-pro-5g">iPhone 13 Pro</a> and are ready to make the most of all the amazing features. We hope you enjoy using your new iPhone.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Following the release of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g\"><span data-contrast="\&quot;none\&quot;">iPhone 13</span></a><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">, we’re starting to see an influx of people switching their phones. The iPhone 13 release saw a range of new colours – a total of nine across the&nbsp;product set, with 5 options in the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini range and 4 in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-pro-5g\"><span data-contrast="\&quot;none\&quot;">iPhone&nbsp;13&nbsp;Pro</span></a><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">&nbsp;and Pro Max range. So much colour choice really allows people to choose an iPhone that reflects their style – and offers plenty of options.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">So, what does your choice of iPhone colour say about you? We spoke to colour specialist Matthew Reacher to find out.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini</span></b></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Black/Midnight </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Black is the original iPhone colour, but this time we see a hint of navy blue added – to curate the colour ‘Midnight’. Matthew says that “choosing a black phone can suggest several things and introverts and extroverts alike might choose a black phone for different reasons.” For introverts, a black phone could be seen as a “non-attention seeking choice”. However, for extroverts it could symbolise “status and power, perhaps professionalism”. For many, black can simply be an aesthetic choice, according to Matthew.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Red</span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Red is most definitely a statement choice. Matthew states that a red phone choice is likely made by someone who is a “socially confident extrovert that often craves being the centre of attention”.&nbsp;It is possible that those who chose a red phone like to be unique and stand out from the crowd. He states that “personal uniqueness is very important to them”.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Blue </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">This time around, the blue model is lighter. In previous versions the blue was darker – with a navy hue. This time we see a lighter version, with hints of turquoise. Matthew believes a blue iPhone is likely chosen if it is a person’s favourite colour “probably due to its relaxing influences”. Those who choose a blue iPhone likely “crave the tranquillity of the ocean”. Additionally, it can suggest a desire for self-expression and creativity.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Pink </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">This time around we see the first baby pink iPhone. Matthew believes that because of pinks association with femininity, the pink phone is likely to be chosen by someone “very in-tune with&nbsp;their femininity”. Likely this person is very “compassionate, affectionate and nurturing”&nbsp;– with a very extroverted personality and social presence.</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">White/Starlight</span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">This white iPhone has a pearly, iridescent hue. Matthew states that there can be different reasons why a person might choose a white phone, the first being that they are an extrovert who enjoys being noticed. However, the second is that it may be the choice of someone who enjoys simplicity and have a strong need for cleanliness and symmetry.</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Graphite </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">The grey or Graphite iPhone is very modern and sleek looking. According to Matthew this iPhone would be the choice of someone who values aesthetics and style but not in regard to impressing other people. “they are likely to be more inner-directed” focussing more on how they perceive themselves.</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Silver </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">With so many similar hues to grey, the silver iPhone has the same connotations as the Graphite version – again this phone is likely chosen by someone who values style and aesthetic but only in respect to themselves and their own opinions.</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Gold </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">A gold iPhone Pro is definitely a statement piece. Matthew states that “Gold is the colour of wealth”. Gold represents status and success and those who choose a gold phone may want to emulate that. Those who choose a gold iPhone are likely to be extroverted and&nbsp;care a “great deal about how others see them.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Sierra Blue </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">There is also a blue version of the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, named Sierra Blue. Again, as blue is synonymous with the ocean and tranquillity it is likely that someone who chooses this colour is introverted and has a desire for calm and values creativity.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">About the Expert&nbsp;</span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://colorpsychologymeaning.com/\"><span data-contrast="\&quot;none\&quot;">Matthew Reacher is a colour&nbsp;expert</span></a><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">&nbsp;who studies colours and their meanings across various areas – including business and branding as well as spiritual significance. Colour psychology considers the various ways in which colour influences our minds and emotions as well as what our own personal colour choices say about our personalities.</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>With the new iPhone on the horizon, we thought it would be a great time to look back on the last 14 years of iPhone and see how far things have come. The first iPhone was introduced in 2007 – it was actually announced 6 months before it even went on sale in the US, which is very different to how the phone is launched now. So, let’s take a look at how the iPhone has developed over the years.</p>
<h2><strong>Apple iPhone</strong></h2>
<p>Released in 2007, in this first-generation iPhone, there was no selfie camera or ability to record video. It did have a standard headphone jack and a range of built-in apps such as safari and maps but it had no app store so you couldn’t download more apps.</p>

<h2><strong>Apple iPhone 3G </strong></h2>
<p>Just a little over a year later, the second iPhone was released – this time aptly named the iPhone 3G as it now included GPS and 3G data. This time the handset was a little thicker than it’s predecessor. This was also the first iPhone to also be available in white. This time, the phone did have the app store, so there was the option to download more apps but still no video recording.</p>

<h2><strong>Apple iPhone 4 </strong></h2>
<p>It wasn’t until 2 years later that the iPhone 4 was released, so as you can imagine big changes came with this new handset. It featured a new sleek design, upgraded camera and the new selfie camera. This launch featured a higher storage capability with the phone now available in 8GB, 16GB and 32GB.</p>

<h2><strong>Apple iPhone 4S </strong></h2>
<p>The iPhone 4S, although at first may not seem like one of the biggest releases, actually featured some pretty impressive changes. In 2011, Apple launched the 4S, the upgraded version of the iPhone 4, with one big difference – this was the first iPhone to feature Apple’s voice assistant – Siri. It also marked the launch of the storage system, iCloud.</p>

<h2><strong>Apple iPhone 5</strong></h2>
<p>The next year saw the release of the iPhone 5, which for the first time featured a larger screen than its predecessors. It was also the first iPhone to feature a selfie camera for other uses than video calling – and Apple have never looked back. This iPhone had major design changes, including the introduction of the smaller USB connector – the lightening cable and the Nano Sim. It was also the last model to be overseen by Steve Jobs.</p>

<h2><strong>Apple iPhone 5S </strong></h2>
<p>Released in 2013, and seen as an upgraded version of the iPhone, the 5S had some pretty interesting new additions. The iPhone 5S again featured the new design and larger screen and came with a storage capacity of up to 64GB. The iPhone 5S was the first iPhone to have fingerprint sensors and to utilise touch access. It also came in more than two colours – this time Apple offered a Space Gray as well as a White/Silver and a White/Gold version.</p>

<h2><strong>iPhone X </strong></h2>
<p>The iPhone 8 launch was somewhat overshadowed by one of Apple’s biggest releases to date – the iPhone X. Although announced at the same time, this release happened a couple of months later in November 2017. It was one of Apple’s biggest design chances that saw a massive increase in screen size as well as a vast range of improvements. At this point Apple got rid of the home button – instead replacing touch access with face recognition.</p>

<h2><strong>iPhone 12</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="\&quot;../mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g\&quot;">iPhone 12</a> is 2020’s flagship phone for Apple. It features a fresh new design and is available in a wide range of colours. The upgrades from the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 12 mainly come from the addition of 5G and in the improved power capabilities. With the launch of the iPhone 12 we also saw the launch of the <a href="\&quot;../mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-pro-5g\&quot;">iPhone 12 Pro</a>, <a href="\&quot;../mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-pro-max-5g\&quot;">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a> and the <a href="\&quot;../mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-mini-5g\&quot;">iPhone 12 mini</a>.</p>

<p>Apple has confirmed they are hosting an event on September 14<sup>th</sup> at 6pm BST (10am PT/1pm ET).</p>
<p>It is widely expected, and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-13-launch-date-confirmed-for-september-14-heres-all-we-know">reported by TechRadar</a> that this will be the launch of what is rumoured to be the iPhone 13. In true Apple style, the announcement of the September 14<sup>th</sup> event did not allude to any specific devices – but it is widely anticipated to include the new iPhone as well as potentially a new Apple watch and even a new iPad.</p>
<p>The event invite features an augmented reality component which lets users look through an Apple shaped portal and see a presumed Californian landscape.</p>
<h2><strong>Handset Rumours </strong></h2>
<p>It is has come to be expected that with any iPhone release, there will be a range of handset options. According to <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-13-release-date-specs-features-leaks-4106939\&quot;" data-wplink-edit="true">Trusted Reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/magsafe-charger-filing-new-iphones/">Mac Rumours</a>, this year will be no different. It is rumoured that once again there will be four handset variations. The names of the handsets are alleged to be: iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p>
<h2><strong>Price and Pre-Order Rumours </strong></h2>
<p>Like everything Apple, the price of the rumoured new iPhone is completely under wraps. But sites, such as <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/deals/iphone-13-deals-how-much-is-apples-latest-device-likely-to-cost">TechRadar</a> who predict these things year on year have taken a stab at what the new phone could be priced at.</p>
<p>It is suggested that what could be called the iPhone 13 will be fairly similar in spec to the iPhone 12 therefore they expect it will have a similar price point. If previous launch events are anything to go by, it is anticipated that pre-orders for the device will begin just a few days after the event – so maybe the Thursday or Friday.</p>
<p>Going by previous launches, and the fact Apple has remained fairly consistent lately with price points – TechRadar suggests that the new iPhone could be priced around £799 – the same as the iPhone 12. If past releases are anything to go by, it is also rumoured there could be an iPhone 13 Mini, Pro and Pro Max. They are rumoured to cost, £699, £999 and £1099 respectively.</p>
<h2><strong>Design Rumours </strong></h2>
<p>Little change is expected in design from the iPhone 12. However, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-13-2021#section-iphone-13-design">TechRadar has reported</a> that there is a potential change in design to the rear camera. It is expected that the lenses will sit in a diagonal pattern. <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/234814/2021-iphone-13-rumors-specs-price-release.html">MacWorld does report</a> that the change in camera design could also see a slightly larger camera ‘bump’.</p>
<p>The other design change that has been highly suggested is a smaller notch, as a result of potentially smaller Face ID sensor. With the Pro and Pro Max, the situation is similar – not many design changes are expected. The only rumours really are surrounding colour options, and potentially less fingerprint prone stainless steel.</p>
<p>In terms of colour – we may see some new shades released with the iPhone 13 – <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-13-2021">TechRadar reports</a> we might see pink and orange and others similar to the 12 like purple. Similar reports have been made by <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/234814/2021-iphone-13-rumors-specs-price-release.html">MacWorld</a> – with iPhone 12 colours all expected to remain.</p>
<h2><strong>Display Rumours </strong></h2>
<p>Again, screen sizes and resolution are not expected to differ much from the iPhone 12. However, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-13-2021">TechRadar reports</a> that the Pro and Pro Max versions could see 120Hz refresh rates. Additionally, they expect to see an always-on display on each of the potential new handsets.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/234814/2021-iphone-13-rumors-specs-price-release.html">MacWorld reports</a> that this ‘always-on’ display could mean we constantly get to see the time, and battery life – perhaps even notifications.</p>
<h2><strong>Camera Rumours </strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-13-2021">TechRadar suggests</a> Apple is expected to tweak the camera on the new handset series. There are a range of rumours – from an upgraded ultra-wide shooter on the pro handsets as well as an upgraded telephoto camera. Video recording improvements are also expected, including a new portrait mode.</p>
<h2><strong>Spec Rumours</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-13-2021">According to TechRadar</a>, the handsets will be powered by the A15 chipset and there are even big rumours flying around that there could be a 1TB iPhone for the first time in 2021. The largest size of &nbsp;iPhone ever made.</p>
<h2><strong>Battery Rumours </strong></h2>
<p>There have been numerous rumours about the battery expected on the new iPhone. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-13-2021">TechRadar</a> suspects that this will be much larger than previous versions – offering better battery life than any previous iPhones. Something Apple fans will be very happy to hear.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/356647/bigger-batteries-could-be-the-star-of-apples-september-event.html">MacWorld reported</a> that the mini handset could see an additional 1 hour of battery life, whilst the rumoured iPhone 13 and Pro could see an increase in battery capacity of 10%. The Pro Max is anticipated to see a huge 18-20% capacity increase.</p>
<h2><strong>Satellite Communication Rumours </strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/uk/news/iphone-13-release-date-price-specs-leaks">Tom’s Guide have reported</a> that the new iPhone is tipped to get satellite communication – which would be the first time for an iPhone. This feature would enable users to make calls or send messages without any 4G or 5G connection. This feature would be revolutionary for emergency calls – for example if you get stranded with no service.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking to brighten up your life? We’ve got just the phone for you! Apple have announced at their ‘Spring Loaded’ event this week that a purple (yes, purple!) <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12 Purple</a> is set to become available, adding to the array of existing colours already on offer since the launch of their latest smartphone last October.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was staged virtually, as was also the case last year, but that didn’t stop the tech giant from sharing its intriguing new innovations with the rest of the world in their own unique way.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12 Purple</a> has been a huge hit with customers, and this new model can be yours for the exact same price as the rest of its kind, meaning you don’t have to worry about paying any extra to add a bit of purple to your purse or pocket.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Sounds great! When can I get my hands on one?</b></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plush purple <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12 Purple</a>, also available on the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-mini-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12 Mini Purple</a>, launched this Friday 23</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rd</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> April 2021 for pre-order from 1pm UK time and you can get yours </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">right here on the Fonehouse site </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(insert link). It will be officially released seven days later on Friday 30</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> April 2021 to all customers who have pre-ordered, and we will begin shipping devices on this date, so act fast to grab yours in time for those early summer barbecues, pub garden drinks and sunny days out with your friends and family.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s the most popular smartphone in the world for good reason, and the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12</a> family has an over 99% customer satisfaction rate thanks mostly to its durable design and immersive display. Big things are expected of the new release, with Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, Greg Joswiak, commenting that “the new purple finish, just in time for spring, adds another bright and fun option to the lineup, and we think customers are going to love it.”</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><i>\&#8221;Apple always create demand. This device is no different. It’s powerful and bold. Every tweak and change Apple introduce is always popular, this new colour looks brilliant, our customers will be after it – as will my wife!\&#8221;</i> – Michael (Store Manager), Fonehouse Belfast</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Why purple? Why not!</b></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple are known for their bright and vibrant finishes and this new purple design joins a snazzy list of fun options in what is an already colourful listing. It contains a range of fantastic features such as an advanced dual-camera system that delivers powerful computational photography and the highest-quality video in a smartphone, expansive edge-to-edge Super Retina XDR displays with OLED for an enhanced, brighter look and a Ceramic Shield front cover which provides the biggest jump in durability ever on an iPhone.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this compliments the stunning flat-edge aluminum feel, perfectly colour-matched to the precision-milled black glass and more immersive viewing experience, not to mention its high-powered wireless charging with MagSafe and an all-new ecosystem of accessories that can be easily attached.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="iPhone 12 - Now in Purple" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFbA9M8g6FE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><b>Throwing it back</b></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Its launch was unveiled at the same time as new brightly iMac computers, available in a rainbow of seven different shades, as Apple add a splash of colour to their collection of marketing-leading devices. The promotional video used to announce the new purple products provided a throwback to earlier purple iMac variations and expressed ‘delicious like candy’ messaging which alluded to Willy Wonka and the famous purple factory the character owned and colourful clothing he’s often associated with.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a moment when people are constantly looking back to nostalgic periods from time gone by, Apple have really hit the ‘sweet spot’ with their new purple finish which just exudes positive vibes and vibrancy – and when do we ever not need some of that!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What else makes the purple iPhone 12 so good?</b></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, where do we start! The durable, elevated, design and immersive display is as beautiful as it is practical, not to mention that the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-mini-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12 Mini purple</a> is the smallest 5G smartphone in the world, packing intelligent technology into a handy, compact size.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watching videos or browsing through photos on the go? The immersive HDR viewing experience is perfect for high-definition video and images with enhanced detail and both models have nearly double the peak brightness of the iPhone 11 – which combined with the new purple finish makes for a delightfully colourful smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an industry-leading IP68 rating for water resistance, you can rest easy knowing your device is protected against everyday spills, up to 6 meters and for up to 30 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, the Ultra Wide camera and a new Wide camera provides 27% more light for incredible video and photo-taking and ensures brighter pictures and better contrast for images taken in low-light settings with Night mode. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Order yours with Fonehouse today</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (insert link) and you can benefit from an end-to-end Dolby Vision experience (the first and only device to provide such a thing), and shoot cinema-grade videos natively on your iPhone.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With playback on the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12 Purple</a>  now more realistic than ever before thanks to the Super Retina XDR display, both models boast improved cinematic video stabilisation and true-to-life selfie videos with Dolby Vision. Other features include longer exposure times for sharper videos, better light trails and smoother exposure in low-light scenarios.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Buy today &amp; do your bit for the environment</b></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you know that <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12</a> models are made of 100% recycled rare earth elements in all magnets? This includes the camera, Taptic Engine and MagSafe, as well as Apple’s MagSafe accessories, whilst the power adaptor and EarPods have also been removed from packaging which further reduces carbon emissions and avoids the use and mining of precious materials, allowing for 70% more boxes to be shipped on pallet.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, this has cut over two million metric tons of carbon emissions each year which, for context, is similar to taking not far off 450,000 cars from the road annually. So not only can you get your hands on a vivacious new purple-coloured phone, but you can also do your bit for the greater good of the planet.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><strong><i>\&#8221;We have already started to receive interest in the new iPhone 12, no changes to the core device but it’s a striking new colour and the fashionistas are keen!\&#8221; </i>– </strong>David (Store Manager), Fonehouse Wokingham</h2>

<p>We’re giving you all the best tips on how to set up a new iPhone so that you can get started quicker than ever before when you receive your phone. From quick tips to longer walk throughs, we’re going to give you everything you need to know. You’ll be set up in no time!</p>
<h2>How to set up a new iPhone</h2>
<p>The first step you’ll have to do once you’ve turned on your mobile phone is select your language. This will make sure that the date and time is correct, and even how the home screen looks. After this, you’ll be asked to connect to your wifi. This is crucial in setting up your phone however, you can use your mobile data if easier. Once you’ve connected to an internet connection, the phone will update to make sure it’s working to its full potential.</p>
<p>Most iPhone’s that are currently available will allow you to set up Face ID or Touch ID. These both offer you super secure access to your mobile phone. You do have the option to set up just a passcode or even no security. We would highly advise that you do set up some sort of security on your mobile phone just to ensure your data stays safe.</p>
<p>From here, you can restore information through a number of different avenues. This includes the ability to restore data from an Android device. You can also choose to set the mobile phone up as an entirely new device if this is what you would like. You’ll then be asked to sign in to your Apple ID and approve a number of different features, such as Siri and automatic updates. Once you’ve accepted or declined these, you’ll be all set to go.</p>
<h2>How to turn an iPhone on</h2>
<p>Of course, turning on an iPhone is one of the first steps to knowing how to set up a new iPhone. It’s actually super easy to turn on a mobile phone. All you need to do is press and hold the power button. This is usually found on the side of the phone but can be found at the top on older devices. You need to hold this down until the Apple logo appears on the screen. You will also notice that the phone vibrates. At this point, you can let go of the button and the phone will turn on in a few seconds.</p>
<h2>Using Quick Start</h2>
<p>Quick Start is an Apple feature that means setting up your new feature so much easier than before. You’ll only be able to use Quick Start if you already have an old iPhone. With this, all you need to do is grab your current iPhone and unlock it. Place this close to your new iPhone and just wait for your new phone to connect. You’ll now get a few instructions on the screen. This just lets you know that the phone is syncing and will set up shortly.</p>

<p>It’s finally the retail holiday that we’ve been counting down for and we’ve got some outstanding iPhone 12 Black Friday deals to kick it off. With the recent release of the iPhone 12, it’s no surprise that they’re carrying some of the best deals around. Whether you’re looking for a high data package or a low monthly cost, we know we’ve got what you need.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>iPhone 12 Deals</h2>
<p>iPhone’s all carrying a relatively high price tag when they’re released. With that in mind, you’re looking at paying around more that £55 per month outside of the Black Friday sales. To bring down monthly costs, you would have to pay a hefty upfront cost, which can seem a bit unachievable. Black Friday is 100% the best time to get your hands on the new iPhone 12 if it’s what you’re dying for this year. You’ll get a lower monthly cost and get a package with tons of data in.</p>
<p>You’ll find iPhone 12 deals across 3 networks we work with, EE, Three and Vodafone. Each of these networks have the best network speeds and coverage available. This means that you won’t have to worry about losing touch with the rest of the world when you venture out. They all also offer a few extras when you join their network. From free subscriptions to money saving discount codes, these networks will find a way to add tons of value to your mobile phone deal.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>About the iPhone 12</h2>
<p>The iPhone 12 was only release a few weeks ago. This is the standard addition to Apple’s 2020 flagship range. This was backed up but the iPhone 12 mini, iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. Since it’s release, the iPhone 12 has been a seriously desirable handset. It’s no shock as it’s an impressive handset. Something that we’ve seen reintroduced is the squared design found on the iPhone 4 range. This gives flat edges to the phone, rather than the thin design we’ve seen these last few years. Although, it’s still a really light handset.</p>
<p>Another thing that has stood out about the iPhone 12 is the fact it’s 5G. This is the first 5G handset to arrive from Apple. When paired with a 5G contract, you’ll be able to experience incredibly fast network speeds. Of course, you will need to be in an area that is covered by 5G. This is all thanks to the A14 Bionic in the iPhone 12. This is actually the fastest chipset in a smartphone so even with 4G speeds, you’ll be able to enjoy a smooth, speedy experience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>iPhone 12 Black Friday Deals</h2>
<p>So, what are the best <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g-64gb-black\">iPhone 12 Black Friday deals</a> for 2020. Well, to no surprise, there are two clear leaders in terms of price. EE are offering the brand new device at only £53 per month with absolutely no upfront cost. This will include 100GB of data in your package. To make the contract that much better, this is of course 5G. When you enter a 5G area, your phone will automatically change from 4G to 5G and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our leading deal on the iPhone 12 is with Three. When you purchase this phone, you will be paying just £47 per month, again with no upfront cost. Not only is this an outstanding price tag, but you’ll also be getting unlimited data, minutes and texts for the entire 24 month contract. This is also a 5G contract so you won’t have to worry about upgrading to a 5G contract once it’s available in your area.</p>
<p>Both of these contracts are covered by our Black Friday Price Promise. This means that you’ll be able to rest assured that you’re getting the best price available. If you happen to come across a deal with a better price, we’ll match it. This will be paid back to you by adding cash back to your order.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Bills for Life</h2>
<p>To make Black Friday 2020 special, we’ve decided to run our biggest competition to date. Every single customer that places an order for a mobile phone up until Cyber Monday at 11:59pm will be entered in for the chance to win they mobile phone bills paid for life. That’s right! Fonehouse will be paying one lucky customers phone bills for the next 20 years. We will be announcing the winner via social media and our website so make sure you keep an eye out.
