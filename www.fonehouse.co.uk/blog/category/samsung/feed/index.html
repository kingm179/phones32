<p>We all use our smartphones to do a range of different things. Whether that’s streaming Netflix late at night, snapping beautiful pictures whilst on holiday, gaming and everything in between.

Fonehouse is here to give you a lineup of the screen sizes of some of the best Samsung handsets on the market. Selecting your dream screen size made easy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It’s back!&nbsp; The Fonehouse price promise, is returning this February.&nbsp; A Fonehouse crowd favourite from our last Black Friday sale, and for a limited time we are bringing it back to you.</p>



<p>Throughout February, you can be sure to get the very best deal against 8 of the largest mobile phone retailers and resellers. Including Mobile Phones Direct, Carphone Warehouse, Vodafone Direct, Three Direct, Buymobiles, Affordable Mobiles, ChitterChatter, Mobiles.co.uk.</p>



<p>Meaning you can switch and fix a new deal for yourself this February and save some much-needed cashola. <strong>Take that energy price hikes!</strong></p>



<p>Our <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-offers">February mobile deals and price match</a> are offered across all your favourite devices. Including the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">iPhone 13 range</a>, <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsung S21 range</a> alongside budget and entry level devices starting from just £14 / month.</p>



<p>We are price matching daily, so if you see a great deal today, be sure to take advantage as it may not be there tomorrow!</p>



<p>This offer will only last until the end of February. With deals this low, you’d be mad not to upgrade your mobile now to the latest handset covered under our price match. For further details see our <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-offers">mobile phone offers</a>.</p>



<h3 id="join-our-campaign-this-february-to-switch-and-fix-a-great-deal"><strong>Join our campaign this February, to &#8220;Switch and Fix&#8221; a great deal</strong></h3>



<p>Fonehouse has launched a new campaign to help our customers save money. With the ever-increasing costs from everything to food and energy, isn’t it time to save money on your next mobile contract?</p>



<p>If you are coming out of a contract elsewhere, you might be able to save a bundle by switching to a new network and tariff through Fonehouse. Martin Lewis recently highlighted the savings people can make on their <a href="https://www.moneysavingexpert.com/news/2022/01/-martin-lewis--paying-more-than-p10-mth-on-your-phone-bill--if-s/">monthly mobile bills</a>.</p>



<p>You too can save if you opt for a SIM only deal through Fonehouse. Although Martin highlighted how <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/best-sim-only-deals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheap SIM plans</a> can go, you’d also best to think about the real data needs you have with you mobile phone. Opting for a cheap 1GB plan will likely leave you at a loss each month when you run out of data.</p>



<p>Fonehouse offers 50GB, 100GB and Unlimited plans to leave you covered for every type of need you can think of. Starting from just £12/month on Vodafone, with 50GB of monthly refresh data and £45 automatic cashback on top (making the monthly line rental effectively £10.13/month) can save you a bundle if you want to keep your same handset.</p>



<p>Or if you can stretch your budget a bit further you can likely save a whole load of cashola from what you pay now by opting for a new contract with a new device and nothing upfront. Take for example the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-5g">Samsung Galaxy S20 FE with 5G</a>, less than 1 year since launch and you can get a 30GB/month data tariff for just £27/month over 24 months. In the UK, the average monthly tariff is around £37/month so that saves you over £240 across 2 years vs. what people pay on average.</p>



<p>Our team can also help you find a way to save this February. You can call our UK customer service team on 0333 900 1133. We are open until 8pm Monday to Thursday, 6pm Fridays and 5.30pm on Saturdays.</p>

<p>Over the years, Samsung have become a particularly popular household name. With so many products we use daily, they are a brand we trust for their design and quality, and they never disappoint. Samsung are now one of the largest producers of electronic devices and continue to be at the forefront of people’s minds when looking to upgrade their smartphones.</p>



<p>At Fonehouse, we know our customers love the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsung</a> brand, as do we. It is trusted, reliable and innovative – so, what is the history of Samsung phones and where did it all begin?</p>



<h2 id="where-was-samsung-founded">Where was Samsung founded?</h2>



<p>Samsung was founded in 1938 in Daegu, South Korea, and was originally known as a grocery trader. The Samsung brand continually changed with the times, however, moving into the electronics sector in the late ’60s. This is when they started manufacturing black and white televisions.</p>



<p>Following the opening of a new development centre in Poland in 2000, Samsung moved into the development of digital TV, eventually making the move into the world of smartphones in the late noughties.</p>



<p>Samsung’s first foray into the world of mobile telecommunications happened a lot earlier however, pioneering the development of mobile phones as early as the 1980s.</p>



<h2 id="when-was-the-first-samsung-phone-released">When was the first Samsung phone released?</h2>



<p>In 1985 the first-ever Samsung phone, an in-car only cell phone, the SC-1000 was released. Sadly, the phone wasn’t a massive success with consumers; the model was plagued with tech issues. The mixed reception to the SC-1000 spurred the Korean-based manufacturer on as they invested heavily in research and development. This culminated in the launch of the Samsung brand’s first fully mobile telephone, the Samsung SH-100.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="460" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.jpeg" alt="Samsung SH-100" class="wp-image-9661" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-150x115.jpeg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-300x230.jpeg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>The Samsung SH-100 boasted several ground-breaking advancements and was also the first mobile phone to be manufactured in Korea. Following the blockbuster launch of its flagship phone, Samsung went from strength to strength, continually thriving in the highly competitive mobile phone market.</p>



<h2 id="moving-with-the-times">Moving with the times</h2>



<p>Between the late 1980s and the millennium, Samsung expanded its mobile phone range and customer offering. They released their first colour mobile phone, the SCH-X430 model, with an LCD colour screen, truly ground-breaking for the time.</p>



<p>Technology has developed at an unprecedented rate since the start of the millennium, and Samsung have continued to rise to the challenge and deliver well designed, high-quality products that withstand the test of time. From touch screens to Flip screens, Ultra and Plus models, Samsung have developed products with consumer needs and usability in mind.</p>



<h2 id="when-was-the-first-samsung-smartphone-made">When was the first Samsung smartphone made?</h2>



<p>Samsung’s first smartphone was the original Samsung Galaxy released way back on June 29<sup>th</sup> in 2009. The Samsung Galaxy GT-17500 boasted cutting edge technology that offered quad-band GSM and tri-band HSDPA.<a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="227" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SamsungGalaxyGTI7500LBellManualUserGuideSpecsOverview-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung Galaxy GT-17500" class="wp-image-9663" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SamsungGalaxyGTI7500LBellManualUserGuideSpecsOverview-1-150x59.jpeg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SamsungGalaxyGTI7500LBellManualUserGuideSpecsOverview-1-300x117.jpeg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SamsungGalaxyGTI7500LBellManualUserGuideSpecsOverview-1.jpeg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></figure>



<p>Running off the then relatively new Android operating system (OS), this model pioneered the Samsung Galaxy line of devices, and helped shape and revolutionise how we use our mobile phones today. Samsung have since excelled in the Android (OS) market.</p>



<p>For over a decade, Samsung have expanded their Galaxy S smartphone range as they have developed new and innovative models, they do not hold back when it comes to design and user capabilities.</p>



<p>Their most recent launch in the S range was the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g">Samsung Galaxy S21</a>; 5G, triple-lens camera for high-resolution, professional images, built-in stereo speakers, and a long-lasting battery are to name only a few of the top features this high specification device has to offer.</p>



<h2 id="samsung-phones-2022-the-future-of-samsung-mobiles">Samsung phones 2022: The Future of Samsung mobiles</h2>



<p>2022 is an exciting year for Samsung. They have the expected arrival of the successor to the S21, the next big Android phone, this is rumoured to be released in February 2022, with a Plus and an Ultra model also rumoured.</p>



<p>Whilst they are known for their top of the market, high-end phones, Samsung have lines in all areas across the market. Their Galaxy A range is ideal for those looking for an affordable handset with a huge range of modern features. Their <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsung Galaxy A10</a> model in particular gives appeal to those customers.</p>



<p>Samsung have also brought the very impressive <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-5g">Samsung Galaxy Z</a> range to market, bringing full-sized smartphones which fold away to a more manageable size, making them easier to store in pockets. The Galaxy Z models are compact, foldable, and water-resistant. Samsung have really listened to their customers when developing this eye-catching model, showcasing their innovative designs.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s been an ongoing argument as to when children should get their first phone, whatever your opinion, these are the best phones for kids. Just like when you get your first car, you’re bound to damage your first phone. That’s why a lot of parents prefer to buy something slightly cheaper whilst their kids are learning to deal with phones as they should.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy A71</h2>
<p>As a rather new release, the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-a71\">Samsung Galaxy A71</a> brings some of the latest features at a much more affordable price. There are two different variants, one being 5G compatible whilst the other isn’t. We’ve included this in our list for the best phones for kids as it’s extremely affordable for what you get. To keep the phone safe, the display is designed with Corning Gorilla Glass 3. This will make smashing the screen that much less likely. Of course, we would also recommend a screen protector for that extra bit of protection.</p>
<p>This device is also top of the list due to the design. With a plastic back, you don’t have to worry about it smashing. That being said, you also get a pretty attractive finish. With a geometric finish when the light hits, your child is bound to fall in love with this. They’ll also have a choice between Prism Crush Black, Prism Crush Silver, Prism Crush Blue and Prism Crush Pink. Having this many colour options allows them to really add their own style to the device, which is sure to make them look after it even more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Apple iPhone 7</h2>
<p>If you were to ask your child what phone they would like, the most likely answer to come out their mouth will be the newest iPhone. Of course, iPhone’s carry quite the price tag. As new phones are released, old phones drop in price. Released in 2016, the iPhone 7 sits at an extremely affordable price with monthly costs being in the teens. With cashback deals, you can reduce these prices to even lower. Not to mention, with the networks available at Fonehouse, you may even be able to use a few extras for yourself.</p>
<p>With the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-7\">Apple iPhone 7</a>, you get all the most important features in one place. As this phone still has a home button, your child can enjoy fingerprint access to their phone. This makes the phone slightly more exciting as it would be should it only have passcode access. They’ll also get access to iOS, which is one of the friendliest operating systems around. This means that should they be struggling to do something, it’s more than likely that you’ll be able to figure it out for them. There are so many different things your child is going to love, apart from the fact they’ll have an iPhone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Huawei P30 Lite</h2>
<p>Of course, we have to cover off at least one smartphone from each of the top three manufacturers. Huawei produces a huge amount of handsets, all being great for children in their own way. In 2019, we were given the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/huawei-p30-lite\">Huawei P30 Lite</a>, which is one of their lower specification phones. Of course, this also makes it cheaper. With extremely high tech features, you child will love this phone. A huge thing they’ll appreciate is the speeds this phone can give out. When they’re playing games, talking to their friends or watching YouTube videos, they’ll be able to do so without interruptions.</p>
<p>Kids love to express themselves through their smartphones nowadays. A great way of them doing this is by taking photos. Lucky for parents, the Huawei P30 Lite doesn’t only have an amazing price, but also an outstanding camera. On the back of the phone is a triple camera consisting of a 48MP main camera, 8MP ultra wide lens and a 2MP depth sensor. Each of these additions to the camera system will allow them to capture photos in the highest quality with great amounts of detail and life like photos.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>iPhone SE</h2>
<p>When we say the iPhone SE is one of the best phones for kids, we mean the up to date one. In 2019, Apple released a new and improved iPhone SE, which holds all the best of the old SE and all the best of modern technology. This is the perfect iPhone for your kids if you’re willing to pay a little more, but not break the bank. Reintroducing a smaller screen means the phone’s far smaller too. With a smaller device, you don’t have to worry about it falling out of pockets or even not fitting into pockets!</p>
<p>A huge perk of the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-se\">iPhone SE</a> is the A13 Bionic chipset acting as the brains of the phone. This component is actually the fastest chipset in a smartphone. You can also find the A13 in the Apple iPhone 11 Pro Max, showing just how high quality it really is. Thanks to this chip, your child can experience the smoothest uploads and downloads, uninterrupted browsing and even buffer free videos. This chip also works to make sure the battery keeping the iPhone SE stays efficient so you don’t have to worry about a dead phone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Best Phones for Kids</h2>
<p>When it comes down to really deciding on the best phones for kids, it comes down to what your child needs and what you can afford. If you can’t fork out for the latest technology, then don’t. Children love the novelty of a smartphone and introducing them to modern technology at the top end will just keep up their expectations. You can find plenty of devices that are super budget friendly but have most modern features. Of course, if you can afford something top end and expensive, then there are plenty of options for you to do so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst these are the best phones for kids in our opinion, there are thousands of other additions you can choose. From huge brands to lesser known manufacturers, there really is something for everyone. You can even find pretty high tech devices at a super affordable price.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsung</a> revealed the new addition to their ever-growing brand, but is the Samsung S20 series waterproof? Samsung revealed their 4 new major handsets to the next S20 range; the Galaxy S20,  Galaxy S20 5G, Galaxy S20+ 5G and the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s20-ultra-5g\">Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G</a>.</p>
<p>The need for a waterproof phone is constantly growing. Whether you worry about your phone in the rain, or you’re one for dropping them in toilets, water resistance an important factor when buying a new phone. Tech-giants Samsung have designed all their high-end smartphones</p>
<p>Looking for the best Samsung Galaxy S20 deals? <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s20-4g\">View deals</a></p>
<h2>How long can the S20 series stay under water?</h2>
<p>Each addition to the S20 series is resistant in water for up to 30 minutes. Any longer means seals may begin to lift and water damage will be inevitable. The newly announced phones are, however, completely resistant to dust.</p>
<p>It’s not guaranteed that your phone will completely break should you keep it in the water any long. We wouldn’t suggest testing this as any warranty won’t cover such damage and you may be forced to pay for the damage yourself.</p>
<h2>How deep under the water can the S20 series go?</h2>
<p>The S20 range is water resistant in up to 1.5 metres. Any deeper than this and the water pressure could cause some serious damage.</p>
<p>Overall, you will be more than fine taking photos next to the pool whilst on holiday or walking places in the heights of a storm. We wouldn’t suggest pushing it too far though!</p>
<h2>What is the IP rating?</h2>
<p>An IP rating is the code given to technology to classify it’s level of protection against dust and water. IP, or ingress protection, is always followed by two numbers. The first being against dust and the second against water. The S20 range has an IP68 rating. This is the highest possible level of dust and water protection among current market leading phones.</p>
<p>The digit 6 means the device is completely ‘dust-tight-. The digit 8 means the phone is suitable for immersion in up to 1.5 metres of water.</p>
<p>All 5 of the phones announced by Samsung follow the same specs when it comes to their water resistance. If you decide to stick with the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s20-plus-5g\">Samsung Galaxy S20+</a> or take a chance on the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s20-5g/essential-plan-25gb-63-new-5g\">Samsung Galaxy S20 5G</a>, you will receive the same level of protection against the elements!</p>
<p>The S20 range has an IP68 rating. This is the highest possible level of dust and water protection among current market leading phones. You can rest assured that your phone will withstand 30 minutes in water up to 1.5m deep with no issues.</p>
<h2>Is the Samsung Galaxy S20 waterproof?</h2>
<p>The most important factor to answering this question is to remember that water resistant does not mean waterproof. Manufacturers don’t currently have the ability or information to make a smartphone completely waterproof.</p>
<p>Whether you decide to go for the lower priced <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s20-4g\">Samsung Galaxy S20</a> or the high-end Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra 5G, you can be assured you are receiving the highest level of protection available. With an IP68 rating, this range has been designed to withstand a fair amount of dust and water.</p>
<p>All phones are only water resistant to a certain point so don’t try pushing the boundaries with a deep-sea dive! You wouldn’t want to risk damaging your part of the new Samsung series.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A huge factor to buying the Samsung Galaxy S10 is whether or not it’s waterproof. A question that is becoming more important when buying a new phone and a very important one to understand.</p>
<p>The amount of people wanting to take tropical photos by the pool is increasing hugely. Modern-day smartphones need to keep up.</p>
<h2>How long can the Galaxy S10 stay under water?</h2>
<p>The Samsung S10 can start under the water for a maximum of 30 minutes without any damage. It’s probably not the best idea to keep your phone in your pocket it you’ve decided to go for a swim. However, you won’t need to worry if you drop it in the pool.</p>
<p>Whilst no one can promise your phone will combust after 31 minutes under the water, the casing of mobile phones are designed to withhold a standard 30 minutes underwater. After this point, water may begin to find it’s way through to the insides of your phone.</p>
<h2>How deep under the water can the S10 go?</h2>
<p>Samsung’s S10 can be submerged in up to 1.5 metres of water. That’s the average depth of a standard swimming pool.</p>
<p>The deeper into water you go, the higher the pressure is. If you were to take your phone any deeper than the recommended depth, you could risk destroying the inner workings on the phone.</p>
<h2>What is the IP rating?</h2>
<p>Ip (Ingress Protection) is the measurement used for levels of dust or water resistance. The S10 has an IP68 rating. This means that there is a guarantee that the phone will be protected in up to 1.5 metres of water for up to half an hour. It also promises that the S10 is safe from contact with dust.</p>
<h2>Is the Samsung Galaxy S10 Waterproof?</h2>
<p>The most important thing to consider when searching for whether or not the Samsung S10 is waterproof is to understand the difference between waterproof and water resistant. If a mobile phone has an IP rating, it is in fact water resistant, meaning it is able to resist the water but not completely.</p>
<p>Overall, the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s10\">Samsung Galaxy S10</a> is definitely water resistant. With an IP68 rating, you can rest assured that your new S10 will be protected if you accidentally drop it down the toilet. Shop <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsung phone deals</a> here at Fonehouse and find the perfect deal. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You have just got your latest and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals\">Samsung Mobile Phone</a>, and now you want to know how to get the best of it. What better than installing some killer apps for it, and these are some of the best that you should download to make the most of your <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus\">S10 Plus.</a></p>
<h2><b>Hidey Hole</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loving the new infinity display, but thinking that the punch holes are ruining it a little, then this is the app for you. This app provides you with a curated list of wallpapers that are designed with the punch holes in mind, and are designed to hide them easily within the design. This means that despite them still being there, you no longer notice them.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This app is constantly updated so you will always find something good to choose from.</span></p>
<h2><b>Holey Light</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the things that having an infinity display does is eliminates the notification LED. Which some people are missing as a quick visual indicator as to what is going on. If you are one of those people then this is for you. What the app does is change the colour of the edge of the punch hole camera to pulse with different colours depending on the notifications. This effectively gives you a notification led, but makes use of the punch hole camera to do so.</span></p>
<h2><b>Battery Ring</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is yet another app that does something different with the punch hole in the display for the camera. This time, it lights up partially around the edge as a visual indicator of how much battery life is left on your phone. With tones of customisation options for colours etc, this a great visual indicator of when you need to charge your phone, or when it is done charging on your bedside table.</span></p>
<h2><b>Borderlight</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This one isn’t about the punch hole thankfully, but instead what this does is give your entire phone a colourful changing border around your screens edge. Think of it as a more colourful replacement to the edge lighting feature that is found on the phone. This gives a great effect and is in keeping with the current trend in accessories on gaming devices, so maybe this just one for the games in the audience.</span></p>
<h2><b>Sound Assistant</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This is unique in that it is an app directly from Samsung, and once installed on your phone it allows you more granular control over how your sound works. It allows you to adjust the sound volume for apps individually as well as change what the volume buttons control, be it media, or call volumes. This is an app that should have been there by default, but as such it is a nice addition.</span></p>
<h2><b>AdHell3</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AdHell3 is one of those useful apps that blocks ads system wide on the phone, it runs as a service in the background, doesn’t require root, and it doesn’t drain your battery, which is fantastic and something that really gives you great control over your phone and saves your data.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s9\">The Galaxy S9’s</a> camera so a leap ahead in terms of the technology. It features a number of innovations, that mean that your photos really pop, and shine in the right light.</span></p>
<h2><b>The Basics</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">On the S9 you get a single lens, dual aperture rear camera. It is a 12-megapixel wide angle lens and has f/1.5 and f/2.4 variable apertures. This also has an auto-focus lens. It is also capable of capturing video in full 4K UHD at 60 fps, and you also get the super slow-motion video capture mode, this will take video at 960 fps. On the front there is an 8-megapixel camera that is great for taking selfies, and also makes your video calls look really great.</span></p>
<h2><b>Performance</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The dual aperture aspect of the lens is designed to improve performance of the camera in low light levels. The selective focus mode uses the dual aperture to bring attention to the object of your picture, whilst blurring out the background. This is a really clever trick, and the dual aperture means that in low light levels you can still get really good results and take great pictures without using the flash.</span></p>
<h2><b>Low Light</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Low light has been the focus by Samsung when it came to the camera this time. They wanted to make sure that when you take a photo, that it doesn’t appear washed out or over exposed. Whilst the camera uses automatic settings by default. You can change these manually to ensure that you get the best photo. This includes selecting which aperture to use. You can also switch the phone into Pro mode, and this gives you manual settings for every option. This requires some experimentation, but you can get some great results. The use of HDR also makes sure that the darkest areas of your phone really pops.</span></p>
<h2><b>Photo Software</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a number of great features included in the camera software, that lets you do many different things. There is an option called AR Emoji, and what this does is use your image to create a number of cartoon animated gifs that you can send to your friends instead of regular emojis. The camera software itself it set up to run everything automatically by default, and this means that most of the time you get the best possible pictures. It includes choosing which aperture to use, and it seamlessly switches between the two depending on the shot. If you find this a little over zealous, then you can use the Pro Mode to override it.</span></p>
<h2><b>Conclusion</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The camera has been greatly improved on the Galaxy S8 and it is so much better than the one on the Galaxy S8. You can spend hours and hours playing with all the different options and changing the settings, whilst you get a load of really good photos. So, whether you are trying to get into photography, or just want to up your selfie game and become the envy of social media. The options are there for you.</span></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you are looking for a new mobile phone pay monthly contract then you might want to wait for <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/Paymonthly\">Black Friday deals</a>. Black Friday falls the day after Thanksgiving, and Thanksgiving is the fourth Thursday in November. While this is not really a significant event in the UK the Black Friday sales have captured the imagination of shoppers and retailers alike.</p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>This year Black Friday will fall on November the 23rd, and although we cannot show you the exciting deals just yet, we can have a look at some of the handsets that might just be making an appearance.</p>
<h3>Samsung Galaxy S9</h3>
<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Now the second in line in the Samsung fold, it stands to reason that this handset could be the subject of many great Black Friday deals. When the newer Galaxy Note 9 was released there were plenty of deals to be had on this powerful, infinity screen mobile. Packed with awesome technology we know that <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/Handset/Samsung-Galaxy-S9\">users of the Galaxy S9 love their handset</a> so why not join them?</p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>The Samsung Galaxy S9 features biometrics in the form of facial recognition, a dual rear camera set up and all of the customisability we have come to love from this manufacturer. The S9 comes in a range of great colours which adds to the appeal and there are plenty of great contract deals available at no upfront cost which makes this an awesome choice. If you prefer the larger handsets then do check out the deals on the Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus which has all the great features in a larger shell.</p>
<h3>iPhone X</h3>
<p style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is common that when flagship phones get replaced they step back into second place and a range of new and budget busting deals opens up. So, the iPhone X is another great offering that is perfect for Apple fans.</p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span>This was the first infinity screen phone released by giants Apple, and the handset offers wireless charging and enhanced biometric security. The A11 Bionic chip brings power and speed to a feature packed phone. With a range of deals for all data allowances available from both Vodafone and EE this is a great Black Friday candidate. <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/Handset/iPhone-X-64GB\">The iPhone X has been widely lauded as a significant leap forward for Apple</a> and a departure from their now iconic bezel style screen seen on many of their earlier models.</p>
