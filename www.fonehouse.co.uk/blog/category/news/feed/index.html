<p>Since the 2019 pandemic struck, working from home quickly became the new normal for millions of workers around the world &#8211; whether you liked it or not. At the peak of the pandemic you probably spent the majority of your week working from your sofa, and feeling a bit lost, well now is it’s time for an upgrade to make your WFH experience just that little bit easier. We’ve put together a list of our top 5 recommended <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals">mobile</a> apps to improve your work from home experience- who doesn’t need a little bit of structure in their life?</p>



<h2><strong>1. Productivity &#8211; Daily Planner</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="480" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/productivity-daily-planner-1024x480.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10078" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/productivity-daily-planner-150x70.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/productivity-daily-planner-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/productivity-daily-planner-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/productivity-daily-planner-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/productivity-daily-planner.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p class="is-style-default">Whilst working from the comfort of your own living room, bedroom or office (if you’re fancy), it can be hard to keep on top of what tasks you need to complete throughout your day and their different priority levels -this is where the ‘Productivity &#8211; Daily Planner’ app comes in. This app allows you to calendarize your daily tasks into a structured easy to follow plan and lets you apply ratings of importance. This app not only makes it easy to follow your agenda for the day and make effective progress but it also time tracks and creates that much-needed structure throughout your WFH day. No more asking yourself ‘but what now?’ as soon as your meetings are finished and 1 PM hits.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Artful Agenda </strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="480" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/artful-agenda-1024x480.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10080" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/artful-agenda-150x70.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/artful-agenda-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/artful-agenda-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/artful-agenda-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/artful-agenda.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When it comes to organisation and planning, some of us are more colourful than others. We’ve all seen those coworkers who beautifully colour coordinate their to-do lists and agendas for the day in the most perfect artsy handwriting. Well if you’re not the most artistic person ever, or if you simply just don&#8217;t have the time, Artful Agenda is here to do all of that creative hard work for you digitally! This calendar app intertwines the functionality of online planners with the aesthetic and feel of a physical planner &#8211; the best of both worlds. Artful Agenda allows you to select particular handwriting styles, check off daily/monthly/weekly tasks, create custom daily tasks lists and even allows you to sync your calendar with other major online platforms like Outlook &#8211; every task you need to complete for work narrowed down into one space. Fun fact, the app even allows you to track your water intake!</p>



<h2><strong>3. Slack</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="480" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/slack-1024x480.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10081" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/slack-150x70.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/slack-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/slack-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/slack-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/slack.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Reading endless chains of emails can sometimes be inconvenient and time-consuming. Slack is a business communication app that makes communication between work teams no matter big or small much easier. The app allows you to personally message particular colleagues and allows you to create dedicated ‘Channels’ (aka tailored group chats) based on what the team is trying to achieve. Slack is the perfect communication hub to get across all the important information your team needs to achieve their goals- no more scrolling through email replies!&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re a business owner, or in a position of management, you should definitely consider signing up your business!</p>



<h2><strong>4. Evernote &#8211; Notes Organizer </strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Evernote-Notes-Organizer.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-10083" width="376" height="376" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Evernote-Notes-Organizer-80x80.webp 80w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Evernote-Notes-Organizer-150x150.webp 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Evernote-Notes-Organizer-300x300.webp 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Evernote-Notes-Organizer.webp 360w" sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" /></figure>



<p>Evernote &#8211; Notes Organizer makes the task of note-taking as simple, fun and efficient as can be. The app allows you to capture all your ideas as soon as inspiration strikes and adds the element of interactivity to spice up any bog-standard notes you’d make with just pen and paper. Once downloaded, you’ll be able to apply articles, web clippings, audio, sketches, PDFs, and documents to any notes you make, handy if you’re in a meeting and you want to add important references to help you out in the future. Another cool feature the app has is scanning. Using your device&#8217;s camera you can scan any paper documents, business cards, whiteboards or handwritten notes straight into your Evernote app -transferring notes made easy!&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>5. StickMe Notes Sticky Notes App</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/stickme-note.webp" alt="" class="wp-image-10082" width="196" height="196" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/stickme-note-80x80.webp 80w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/stickme-note-150x150.webp 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/stickme-note-300x300.webp 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/stickme-note.webp 460w" sizes="(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px" /></figure>



<p>Jotting down notes on a physical sticky note is so old school, not only can these be easily misplaced, but this method isn’t particularly organised in the long run. The StickMe Sticky Notes App allows you to digitally store quick hand sticky notes instead, on any device of your choosing. The app also allows you to apply audio, freehand text and photo notes to your sticky note reminders, and can be added as a widget to your <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">iPhone</a> home screen! This is an app that is bound to remind you of the little tasks that might slip your mind whilst working from home.</p>

<p>We all have the part of ourselves that deep down that is basically a self-acclaimed photographer. Historically in the early days of mobile phone releases, you had to actually invest in a camera in order to take professional-worthy photos -a lot of effort we know. Nowadays we’re lucky enough to have stunning high-quality cameras which are incorporated within our handsets instead &#8211; professional worthy photography in the palm of our hands. We at Fonehouse want you readers to have the best photo’s possible, so we’ve put together a trustee FAQ guide to phone photography, keep reading and enjoy!</p>



<h2><strong>What Is The Best Phone For Photography?</strong></h2>



<p>There are a lot of amazing handsets on the market which excel when it comes to photography. It seems as if with every device launch, each telecommunications company is trying to outdo each other with how impressive their camera is. One camera we think is worth all the hype is on the<a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-5g"> Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra</a>. The rear of this device has an impressive quadruple-camera array. This consists of a 12MP ultra-wide lens, a 1080MP Wide-angle lens, a 10MP telephoto lens with 3X Optical Zoom and lastly, a 10MP additional telephoto lens with 10X optical zoom- if reading that just sounded like a bunch to tech talk, in simpler terms this device provides users with crystal clear imagery with wide coverage at a touch of a button</p>



<h2><strong>How To Start Photography With Your Phone&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10311" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/amir-hanna-sweUF7FcyP4-unsplash-1-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>Photography is becoming more popular than ever. Whether that&#8217;s professionally or for fun, it&#8217;s a creative avenue that is truly booming. If you’re a beginner at phone photography we recommend that you start by making use of the handy gridlines feature to balance your shot. By turning this feature on, a series of symmetrical grid lines broken into thirds (horizontally and vertically) will appear on your screen. The theory is that if your subject of interest is within the intersections, this will create tip-top photo composition, and will balance out any empty space &#8211; making your shot instantly more visually appealing. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Another tip we recommend you do to get your phone photography game up to the next level is fine-tuning and amending certain aspects of your shots. Smartphones over the years have come a long way. Most phone cameras nowadays autoselect aspects like the brightness, focus and exposure of your shot, but if you take it into your own hands to personalize these instead, it can be a big help in improving the overall quality of your images. On most handsets, once you open your camera app there&#8217;s normally a dial or slider which allows you to adjust the brightness and exposure level. If on the other hand, your camera isn’t focusing the way you&#8217;d like it to, on the majority of devices like<a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals"> iPhones</a> and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsungs</a>, all it takes is a simple tap on the area you want to focus on instead to readjust.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Which Phone Is Best For Night Photography?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10313" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/cristian-lozan-OE1b_ewAsaU-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>If you’re a regular nighttime photo taker, the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-11">iPhone 11</a> is an affordable device that has a smashing Night mode for you to indulge in! This is a device that allows you to capture all the beautiful magic within a shot at any hour of the day. The iPhone 11 gets an A star rating when it comes to its top-notch night photography power. If you’re already an iPhone 11 owner, or if you’re looking to purchase one, to turn on Night Mode all you have to do is<strong> open your camera &gt; tap the moon icon </strong>in the left-hand corner, and this icon will turn yellow when the mode is active. To get the best results possible, make sure you have a steady hand and don&#8217;t move your device too quickly after taking the shot (this prevents any annoying blurs from occurring). Nighttime darkness is no longer an interference in the game of photography.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Which Aspect Ratio Is Best For Phone Photography</strong>?</h2>



<p>When it comes to the technicality behind photography, there are little aspects you can tweak which can make a huge difference &#8211; aspect ratio being one of them. The aspect ratio of an image is the ratio of its width and height. It’s been found that there are certain aspect ratio sweet spots, that you can select depending on where you aim to post the photos, which give you the best-looking photos possible. For example, if you’re going to post your photo on Instagram, a 4:5 aspect ratio is recommended due to the platform&#8217;s vertical post layout. Always research your aspect ratios.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Flashback to September 2021, the sparkling new<a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g"> iPhone 13</a> hit the market and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">Apple</a> fans all over the world were eager to get their hands on the new device &#8211; even if that meant queuing up outside of their local Apple store for hours! If you were one of the lucky ones who were able to secure the device, or even if you’re a recent iPhone 13 user, we’ve put together a list of 10 handy iPhone 13 hacks you need to know.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Put A Stop To Apps Tracking You</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve all been in the situation where you’ve typed something random in on an app, and ever since then, you can stop seeing ads/content based on your search. The majority of apps nowadays track various patterns of usage and data whilst you use their app, this is done to serve you more relevant and personalised content in the future. Some people love this tracking feature, but some hate it. For all those who find this feature too invasive, you’ll be happy to hear the iPhone 13 now allows you to block apps from tracking your usage. If you go to <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy</strong> and select ‘<strong>Tracking</strong>’ you should see a toggle at the top of the screen that says ‘Allow Apps to Request to Track’. By turning this toggle off, this will prevent apps from even being able to ask you to track your usage &#8211; no cookies gained, and a final stop to in-app tracking.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Scan Text Through Your Camera</strong></h2>



<p>Pretty much every important document these days is digitalised, whether it’s a contract, an important bill or even your ID. The ‘Live Text’ feature on the iPhone 13 allows you to scan any physical text with your camera, and automatically transfer it over to your device. All you have to do is open your camera, position your device so the text is clearly within the shot, and a yellow frame should appear around the detected text. Then you should be able to manipulate the grab points you want and then copy and paste the text into any space of your choosing (your notes app for example). This super cool feature also works with photos you’ve previously taken. All you have to do is simply go to your camera roll, highlight any text within a photo, then you should be able to copy it and paste it elsewhere &#8211; pretty cool stuff right?<br><br></p>



<h2><strong>3.</strong> <strong>Facetime With Non-Apple Users</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="489" height="1024" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-facetime-web-android-call-in-progress-489x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10046" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-facetime-web-android-call-in-progress-72x150.png 72w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-facetime-web-android-call-in-progress-143x300.png 143w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-facetime-web-android-call-in-progress-489x1024.png 489w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-facetime-web-android-call-in-progress.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 489px) 100vw, 489px" /></figure>



<p>Facetime over the years has become a huge hit amongst Apple users, but I&#8217;m sure everyone has a friend who is solely team Andriod. But did you know that you can actually Facetime with someone who doesn&#8217;t own an Apple product? &#8211; A Windows or Android user for example. All you have to do is go into Facetime &gt; Select Create Link &gt; Press Copy, and then you can send this link through messages or even email.&nbsp; Any person on the receiving end of this link no matter what device they’re on will automatically be able to Facetime with you. We think Facetime is so great that everyone should be able to enjoy it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. Send Web Pages Via Siri</strong></h2>



<p>As humans, we’re constantly interacting with our friends via our phones, whether that&#8217;s an actual phone conversation, or simply sending memes back and forth. If you’re on a webpage you want to show a friend, instead of copying and pasting the link, you can now get the famous Siri to do all the hard work for you. All you have to do is whilst on the web page, say “Hey Siri send this to *insert friend name*”. Then Siri will then automatically copy this link and send it over to the person of your choice via text message. Sending content made easy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>5. Turn Your Live Pictures Into Videos</strong></h2>



<p>We’ve all probably played around with the famous ‘Live Photos’ option on our iPhone cameras. But these types of photos can only be played within our camera rolls if we press the image and hold down. However, if you press the ‘Share’ icon on any live photo of your choice (which is located in the bottom left-hand corner), scroll down and then select <strong>‘Save As Video’</strong>. This will then save your live photo as a 3-second video instead within your main camera roll &#8211; you’ll be surprised as to just how much is captured within only 3 seconds! The hassle of holding down your live photos just to view them is finally over.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>6. Require Attention For Face ID</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="664" height="910" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-settings-face-id.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10047" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-settings-face-id-109x150.png 109w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-settings-face-id-219x300.png 219w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-settings-face-id.png 664w" sizes="(max-width: 664px) 100vw, 664px" /></figure>



<p>I&#8217;m sure you’ve seen all the funny tweets online of people expressing their worries about their <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">iPhone</a> being unlocked via Face ID whilst they’re asleep &#8211; I mean it is a pretty valid concern. Well, you’ll be thrilled to hear that you can actually stop this travesty from happening. If you go to your Settings &gt; Face ID &amp; Passcode &gt; and make sure both the ‘Require Attention For Face ID’ and ‘Attention Aware Features’ toggles are both on. This will then require both your eyes to be open and looking at the screen in order to unlock your device via Face ID. Even if this isn’t a concern for you, it’s still recommended that you do this as an extra level of protection for your device&#8217;s sensitive data.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>7. Bundle Non-Important Notifications </strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="506" height="1024" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-lock-screen-notification-summary-506x1024.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10045" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-lock-screen-notification-summary-74x150.png 74w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-lock-screen-notification-summary-148x300.png 148w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-lock-screen-notification-summary-506x1024.png 506w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/ios15-iphone12-pro-lock-screen-notification-summary.png 640w" sizes="(max-width: 506px) 100vw, 506px" /></figure>



<p>If you’re a person who is a serial app downloader you probably get a million unimportant notifications a day ranging from 20% off sales to new filters being available -which at times can be distracting. iOS 15 has a cool feature called ‘Notification Summary’ which enables you to bundle all the less important notifications together and allows you to receive them at the same time rather than receiving random pings throughout the day. To do this all you have to do is go to <strong>Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; Scheduled Summary &gt;</strong> then<strong> toggle this on</strong>. After this, you’ll automatically be taken to a setup page where you can scroll select the apps you deem less important and want to include within your summary (you can make as many different summary groups as you want). After you’ve added the apps to your summary you can now schedule specific times you want these notifications to appear as a group. Once this is done, all you’ll need to do is press the ‘Turn On Notification Summary’ button at the bottom, and from now on only the apps that aren&#8217;t included within your summaries (i.e the important ones) will show immediately and at whatever time throughout your day.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>8. Double Tap The Back Of Your iPhone</strong> <strong>To Screenshot</strong></h2>



<p>Fumbling to press the right buttons in order to take a simple screenshot can be quite annoying. With the right accessibility function enabled you can simply tap twice on the back of your iPhone 13 to take a screenshot instead. Head to <strong>Settings &gt; Accesbaility &gt; Touch &gt; Back Tap &gt; Double-tap </strong>and then find ‘<strong>Screenshot’ </strong>within the presented list (warning you might have to do a bit of scrolling). Now when you double-tap the back of your iPhone it will now take a screenshot! No more faffing around with buttons.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>9. Photographic Styles</strong></h2>



<p>Another cool new camera feature on the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g">iPhone 13</a> is Photographic Styles. Unlike your bog-standard filters, Photographic Styles allows you to adjust and fine-tune aspects like warmth, brightness and contrast to create an aesthetic that will be applied to all of the photos you take. To use this head to your <strong>Camera</strong>, and select the camera controls button &nbsp;<img loading="lazy" width="20" height="20" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/9NqMZJsLtHkxbIc3HuHfwgb8QPfI5W7JCjUxX5e33xm8-D6zm1qnqza9iJuub2_6WXOXBBJ2Srw_9lHgphLT06DqVYZNbap29G04ljQsH-v7qxs4HIzvLiYAHqZK4ZLivnjbIUK5" alt="the Camera Controls button">. Then select the photographic styles button <img loading="lazy" width="20" height="23" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/GzXWWp24j2SV-SBsURWSFZEaoNrU8X1Q4h9RORh9XuMz_0bN2pgDg8W2g5iTCoNQLkVZdREIKOi6buut2TAlDzCYwndmKOHWWkPTD7FHHhvZkJlNrDN23_LMXDmipoZGhxPz-ntu" alt="the Photographic Styles button">. Swipe left to a get a preview of all the different styles, and if desired customise the style by tapping the Tone and Warmth controls which sit below the frame. Lastly, tap the photographic style button again <img loading="lazy" width="27" height="31" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/_cz7LGz1xMrhTUe0PCa9C5lqxOlvTf-HU-6oLS_FLLKr7TRAnSiOmvtYbqJUI03XcJO2aZxU5aUJMYhHVitH2NveYOYBHtw3BgwDwshMMwCsv-4IaZfDdwa_SvgCRoA93OOqfjO1" alt="the Photographic Styles button"> to apply the style to your camera.</p>



<p>If you perhaps have a change of heart and want to change your photographic style at any point, just select the photographic styles icon again at the top of your screen.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>10. Keyboard To Trackpad</strong></h2>



<p>Sometimes it can be quite tricky to precisely move your cursor whilst you’re typing on your iPhone &#8211; especially if it&#8217;s a lengthy bit of text. To defeat this issue you can actually turn your keyboard into a trackpad, instantly giving you better precision whilst navigating through text on your device. To do this is simple. All you have to do is press and hold the space bar while typing (this will then make any other keys grey out). Then swipe your finger across the spacebar (still holding down on the screen) to enter keyboard trackpad mode. Now you’ll be able to move your text cursor anywhere on your screen with immaculate precision. To exit this mode just simply lift your finger. Once you try this you’ll never go back to standard text selection again.&nbsp;</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="480" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/phone-care-1024x480.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10013" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/phone-care-150x70.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/phone-care-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/phone-care-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/phone-care-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/phone-care.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>When we first invest in a shiny new handset, we become obsessed with the idea of it remaining perfect &#8211; scratch, smear and blemish-free. So much so that some of us even leave the plastic coating that the phone came in on for weeks. Mobile maintenance can be tough. With so many accessories on the market, it’s hard to know which ones are effective and worth your while. This step-by-step guide will give you all the tips and tricks on how to care for your mobile phone to the best of your ability.</p>



<h2><strong>Step 1 &#8211; Buy A Protective Case</strong></h2>



<p>After you’ve researched, added to your basket and paid for your new device, the first thing you should do is purchase <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/mobile-phone-cases">a phone case</a>. A durable phone case will shield your device from any drops, spills and other clumsy mistakes that you might make throughout your journey with your handset. Fonehouse has some of the best mobile phone cases in the market for all different types of devices ranging from Apple to Samsung, Huawei to Sony. Various different accident-proof materials such as silicone and hard-shell plastic are also up for grabs. You can even buy protective mobile cases which have built-in cardholders!</p>



<h2><strong>Step 2 &#8211; Protect Your Screen</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="854" height="600" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/screen-protector.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10014" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/screen-protector-150x105.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/screen-protector-300x211.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/screen-protector-768x540.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/screen-protector.jpg 854w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></figure>



<p>We’ve all probably smashed or scratched our mobile screen once or twice in our lives, right? To avoid this tragedy, we suggest you save yourself the trouble and buy yourself a mobile phone <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/screen-protector">screen protector</a>. Although the screens on modern-day smartphones are becoming more smash and scratch-resistant this is not 100%, and there is still a chance that your screen can face damage. Something as small as a coin in your pocket can cause some small but extremely irritating damage to your screen. A tempered glass screen protector will act as a barrier between the world and your device, if damaged you can easily remove and reapply a new one &#8211; it’s better to be safe than sorry. If you want to know how to fit a screen protector to your mobile phone, check out this quick <a href="https://youtu.be/LpYCVneB4ko">video!</a></p>



<h2><strong>Step 3 &#8211;</strong> <strong>Mobile Phone Battery</strong> <strong>Maintenace</strong></h2>



<p>Make sure your charger is legitimate. Sometimes the use of inauthentic third-party charging accessories can <a href="https://www.electronicproducts.com/how-a-fake-charger-is-killing-your-phones-battery-and-what-you-can-do-about-it/">deteriorate the quality of your battery</a>. If your handset on delivery came with a charging cable in the box, you’re in luck! Currently, more companies are opting for a smaller box on delivery, and not including chargers with new devices. Fonehouse has a wide selection of authentic charging accessories ranging from <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/iphone-lightning-cable-1m-white-devia">lightning cables </a><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/mobile-phone-cables-and-chargers">to</a><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/wireless-ultra-slim-charging-pad-black-10w-devia"> wireless charging pads</a> to give your battery the healthy boost that it needs. Don’t forget to not overcharge your device! Regular overcharging is another thing that can take a toll on your battery health over time.</p>



<h2><strong>Step 4 -Keep It Clean</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="854" height="600" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/keep-it-clean.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10016" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/keep-it-clean-150x105.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/keep-it-clean-300x211.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/keep-it-clean-768x540.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/keep-it-clean.jpg 854w" sizes="(max-width: 854px) 100vw, 854px" /></figure>



<p>This step isn’t essential to making your handset last, but it could be a big help in maintaining the overall cleanliness and quality of your device. <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=mobile+cleaning+kit&amp;crid=2Y7R7CBCH2ASD&amp;sprefix=mobile+clean%2Caps%2C114&amp;ref=nb_sb_ss_ts-doa-p_3_12">Cleaning kits </a>are available for the majority of devices. These kits typically include specifically shaped foam-tipped swabs to get into the tiny nooks and crannies of your device that are hard to reach, and where dirt builds up such as the headphone jack and microphone. Clearing these areas from build-up can not only improve the quality of your audio (input &amp; output) but it also leaves your device looking visibly cleaner. Anti-smear fabric or disposable wipes are also what you can expect within a kit, perfect for wiping away stains and build-up. If you’re lucky another item you’ll receive in a standard cleaning kit is a Nylon cleaning brush, this can be used to wipe away any dirt and is also great for using on other gadgets you might have like tablets and laptops.</p>



<h2><strong>Step 5 &#8211;</strong> <strong>Be</strong> <strong>Wise</strong></h2>



<p>The final step is about choices rather than a purchase. It might be common sense but try not to do anything too crazy with your device. The less risk, the better. Although some modern-day smartphones like the<a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g"> iPhone 13</a> have cool features like 6-metre water resistance and dust resistance, mobile phones aren’t completely invincible… yet. Be smart with your handset.</p>

<p>When it comes to mobile contracts everybody wants to cut back on costs &#8211; especially with the price of living increasing. You shouldn’t have to feel torn between picking a plan that you require usage wise and saving money. We’re here to help you out and give you Fonehouse’s top 5 tips for saving money on your monthly mobile phone bill.</p>



<h2><strong>Tip 1: Consider A SIM Only Contract</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="480" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sim-only-mobile-deals-1024x480.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10025" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sim-only-mobile-deals-150x70.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sim-only-mobile-deals-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sim-only-mobile-deals-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sim-only-mobile-deals-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/sim-only-mobile-deals.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/best-sim-only-deals">Sim-Only contracts</a> are taking over. These types of contracts are perfect for those who perhaps have an old device they want to continue using, or for people who have purchased a new device outright. SIM-Only contracts only require customers to pay a super cheap monthly bill for a SIM card with a text, minutes and data bundle included &#8211; a cheap solution to cutting costs. Not only are SIM-only contracts affordable (typically ranging from just £6 to £15 per month), but there&#8217;s a huge selection of plans up for grabs for all different types of users. Whether you love to constantly watch YouTube videos and Tik-Toks whilst on the go, or if you keep your data usage to a minimum, there will always be a specific SIM-Only plan for you.</p>



<h2><strong>Tip 2: Tailoring Your Search</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="393" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/website-filter-deals-1024x393.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10026" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/website-filter-deals-150x58.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/website-filter-deals-300x115.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/website-filter-deals-768x295.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/website-filter-deals-1024x393.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/website-filter-deals.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>You’ve just got paid, your old handset is a bust, you have a dream mobile in mind, but you don&#8217;t want to splash too much cash &#8211; this is where tailoring your search comes in. On Fonehouse depending on which device you’re interested in, under the &#8216;Sort By&#8217; tab you can narrow down the different available contracts into three different sections: Effective Cost, Popularity, and Total Cost. The ‘Effective Cost’ option will be your best friend when it comes to saving money on your mobile contract. After you select this, Fonehouse does all the hard work and ranks which contracts will allow you to get the most for your money, in terms of data, minutes and texts. We at Fonehouse ensure customers only pay the best and fairest prices for what they receive &#8211; no extortionate pricing over here.</p>



<h2><strong>Tip 3: Always Check The Deals Page</strong></h2>



<p>Who doesn’t love a good deal? Every month Fonehouse release an amazing set of <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-offers">special offers</a> for tech-loving customers to get their hands on and enjoy. These offers range from price-matched <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-pro-5g-128gb-graphite">iPhone 13 Pro 5Gs</a> to <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g-128gb-phantom-white">Samsung Galaxy S21 5Gs</a> &#8211; there really is a deal for everyone.

<p>When it comes to selecting a mobile network, affordability, reliability, and speed are three key areas people look for &#8211; 3 things Vodafone knocks out of the park. From flexible and cheap <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/network/vodafone-mobile-phone-deals">Vodafone mobile contracts</a> to Vodafone TV, it truly is a company that does it all. If you want a run down about Vodafone as a brand, what they’ve achieved, and what they have to offer their customers Q&amp;A style keep reading!</p>



<h2><strong>How Many Countries Does Vodafone Operate In?</strong></h2>



<p>Vodafone since its humble beginnings in 1984 has made a huge impact in the world of telecommunications. Currently, Vodafone operates across 21 countries over two geographical regions, Europe, and the rest of the world. These countries include Turkey, Albania, Tanzania, Greece, and many other beautiful hotspot destinations.</p>



<h2><strong>Exactly How Succesful Are Vodafone?</strong></h2>



<p>As you’ve probably guessed, Vodafone is hugely successful in what they do. In the majority of its operations, they are within the top 2 spots of the largest mobile operators, and they are Europe&#8217;s largest 5G network provider &#8211; giving users more of what they enjoy, at fasters speeds. Vodafone is also known for being the best mobile network for people looking for varied and affordable data bundles as well as unlimited 5G.</p>



<h2><a></a><strong>What Are Vodafone’s Network Speeds like?</strong></h2>



<p>Each year Vodafone aims to become bigger and better than ever. This means improved network speeds, increased reliability, and even stronger 5G &#8211; a company that is always striving for greatness. One thing Vodafone has covered is providing its users with super-speedy access to content. The <a href="https://www.vodafone.co.uk/cs/groups/public/documents/webcontent/vfcon111128.pdf">2021 UK Mobile Performance Review </a>by Root Metrics, reported that Vodafone was 1 out of 2 network providers that provided download speeds faster than 50 Mbps. Whether you’re a person who loves to open 10 internet tabs at a time or a person who’s constantly calling their friends, Vodafone is a network that always aims to support you within your ventures.</p>



<p>5G is the future. A great 5G provider should allow strong connection in heavily populated areas, faster downloads, flawless streaming, HD video calling and no lagging &#8211; ultimately making the usage of your device more fluent. Since 2020 Vodafone has shown massive improvements within its 5G mobile data service. In 2021 it&#8217;s every day 5G availability improved across all 13 of its cities, and the network had increased median download speeds in a total of 11 cities. In the world of Vodafone, losing connection, long loading speeds and lagging are simply a thing in the past.</p>



<h2><strong>How do I Keep My Mobile Number On Vodafone?</strong></h2>



<p>You want to make the big switch over to the trustee Vodafone network, but you want to keep your existing mobile number- we’re here to help you out a bit. If you’re joining Vodafone from another network provider, you’ll need three things: your temporary Vodafone number, the number you want to keep and a Porting Authorisation Code (PAC code). To get this code, all you’ll need to do is text the word ‘PAC’ to the number ‘65075’, this will request your code from your current network provider free of charge (this code typically lasts 30 days, and after this duration, you’ll have to request a new code). Upon securing your new Vodafone contract, you’ll just need to provide them with this PAC code, and then Vodafone will do all the work and make the transfer to switch over your device from your temp number to the mobile number you want. Once your number has been transferred over to Vodafone, you might temporarily lose service and you might need to turn your device on and off to complete the process.</p>



<p>Alternatively, if you would like to take a new number, and cancel your old contract, you’ll need a Service Termination Authorisation Code (STAC Code). To get this code from your existing provider you’ll just need to text the word: ‘STAC’ to the number ‘75075’ &#8211; again completely free of charge and give this code to Vodafone to sort out on your behalf.</p>

<p>Apple lovers across the globe eagerly tuned in to Apple&#8217;s live event on the 8th of March, which saw the release of the new <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-se-5G">iPhone SE</a>. The iPhone SE is the newest budget-friendly device on the market for <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a>, following their previous 2020 SE release. Now you’re probably wondering, ‘what exactly has changed in the space of two years?’ &#8211; well to answer your question, quite a lot.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5><strong>Colours, Colours, Colours</strong></h5>



<div class="wp-container-3 wp-block-group"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container">
<p>The 2020 iPhone SE was released in 3 colour options: Black, White and Red &#8211; pretty standard. The brand spanking new 2022 iPhone SE however is up for grabs in the colours Midnight, Starlight and Red, the shades are the same but the names have been spiced up a bit.<a></a><a></a></p>
</div></div>



<div style="height:19px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5><strong>So What About The Chip?</strong></h5>



<p>You’ve got to love a chip upgrade, The 2020 version of the iPhone SE ran primarily on an A13 Bionic processing chip. At the time this chip was pretty mindblowing for the iPhone SE, as you would’ve gotten the same chip that&#8217;s in the iPhone 11, iPhone 11 Pro and the iPhone 11 Pro Max. As you probably predicted over the span of two years Apple has conjured up something newer and more powerful than ever: the A15 Bionic Chip- the chip that enhances everything you do. This is the chip that’s installed within the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro and now the 2022 iPhone SE -making the new SE considerably more powerful than the previous model.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="370" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-colours-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9927" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-colours-2-150x79.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-colours-2-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-colours-2.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5><strong>Size &amp; Display</strong></h5>



<p>Sorry…nothing to see here, both the 2020 and the 2022 iPhone SE have the same 4.7-inch pocket-friendly size &#8211; the same as the iPhone 8. Additionally, both the models have the same 1334-by-750-pixel resolution (if it works well why change it?). A great similarity between the devices is the remain of the trustee home button, a feature deeply missed on Apple’s latest releases.</p>



<div style="height:10px" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<h5><a></a><strong>Smile For The Camera</strong></h5>



<p>Although the single rear 12MP lens has remained the same on both the 2020 and the 2022 iPhone SE, it&#8217;s the A15 Bionic chip that really sets the two devices apart. With this swanky new chip, you’ll now have full access to cool camera features like Deep Fusion, Smart HDR, Portrait mode and various other photographic styles &#8211; a door opened. So if you lover of snapping pics, it&#8217;s definitely worth making the switch over to the newer iPhone SE. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="700" height="370" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-2022-Camera-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9928" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-2022-Camera-1-150x79.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-2022-Camera-1-300x159.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/iphone-SE-2022-Camera-1.jpg 700w" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /></figure>



<h5><strong>A Bump in Battery</strong></h5>



<p>Both the 2020 and the 2022 iPhone SE batteries are fast charging compatible (18W) and enable you to get a 50% charge in just 30 minutes. However, you&#8217;ll be happy to hear there has been a significant increase in playback time in the new device. The 2020 version offered up to 13 hours of video playback, up to 8 hours of streamed video playback and up to 40 hours of audio playback. The 2022 version however offers up to 15 hours of video playback, up to 10 hours of streamed video playback, and up to 50 hours of audio playback &#8211; the newer SE definitely wins the competition on length of usage. More time to do the things you love on your device.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-11-pro">new iPhone 11 Pro</a> hits the shelves users are starting to discover the cool features and tricks. To save you time we have put together a series of blogs that will help you customise your new phone and make it do all the things you ever wanted &#8211; except make the tea, but we are sure that will be coming soon!</p>
<h2><b>Remaining Battery </b></h2>
<p>Knowing how much battery your handset has left is always useful, especially when you are out and about for the day. The good thing with the iPhone 11 Pro is that the battery life is fantastic. When they released the iPhone XS last year the battery life was much extended and seriously impressive.</p>
<p>This time Apple has managed to make even more progress and added an average of 4 hours to the battery time of the XS. So, it really should last you all day even when you are out and about. You will be used to the battery indicator along the top of the screen, and this shows an approximate amount of battery remaining, but until you plug it into the charger or set it down on a wireless charger, you can never be sure exactly how much is left.</p>
<h2><b>Showing the Percentage</b></h2>
<p>Now, if you are out and about, then you won’t always have a charger with you and might wonder just what is going on with the health of the battery. The good news is in one move you can check what percentage of battery the phone is on. The information is located in the control centre, and if you are not familiar, this is a great screen that has lots of useful settings available in a single swipe. If you swipe down in a diagonal direction from the top right-hand corner of the screen, you will see that the battery symbol still appears at the top and now next to it the percentage remaining will be shown.</p>
<h2><b>Low Power Mode</b></h2>
<p>There is one other small adjustment you can make to your control centre that will also help in managing the battery. To set this up for the first time you will need to head into your settings app and from here choose control centre. Here you will see the shortcuts already set up and a list of others you can add.</p>
<p>Scroll down until you find low power mode and hit the green plus sign to add it. Head back to the main screen and swipe down to open the control centre. You will see the new icon, and when you click this on the handset goes into low power mode conserving as much power as possible. The battery along the top will go yellow to show you are in low power mode. Once you are back to a charger simply access the control centre again and toggle low power mode to off. To close the control centre swipe up from the white bar shown at the bottom of the screen.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So let’s take a look at the<a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals\"> iPhone 11 Pro</a>. There is no doubt that it is a very impressive handset which offers a lot to people. There are a lot of functions that you should probably think about, but how often do you stop to consider the most basic task of them all? </span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Turning off your phone is a basic requirement. You have to make sure that you can switch it off for a variety of different situations because it can be necessary. So let’s take a look at how you switch the phone off and make the most from it. </span></p>
<h2><b>Why You Need to Turn Off Your Mobile Device</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">There are a lot of different reasons why you need to switch off your phone. For example, you may encounter a situation where it interferes with specific equipment and putting it onto Airplane Mode just won\&#8217;t do it. In those situations, you have to be able to turn the phone off quickly and efficiently. If you don’t know how to do that, however, then you could be in for a problem. </span></p>
<h2><b>Turning</b> <b>The Device Off</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Okay, so let’s take a look at how you turn off the phone. What will probably confuse people at first is the Apple haven’t put a dedicated switch off button on the device. In fact, that’s been a mainstay feature of their phones for quite some time now. Instead however, you have to look at the lock button before turning the phone on and off.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So what you’re going to want to do is press and hold the lock button until such a time as the new menu prompt comes up. This menu will ask you to slide your thumb across the display which will, in turn, switch the phone off. It’s literally as easy as that.</span></p>
<h2><b>Turning the Phone Back On Again</b></h2>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So now that you’ve learned how to turn the phone off, you’re probably going to want to know how to turn it back on again. Thankfully, this isn’t particularly difficult. Once again, you just need to press and hold your lock button. If you wait a few seconds when you do this, then you’ll see the Apple logo come up on the screen which indicates to you that the phone is about to turn on again. The process takes around 5 to 10 seconds, so not that long really.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So in conclusion, knowing how to turn your phone on and off is not a difficult thing by any means. However, it does rely on you being able to work your phone quickly and efficiently. It can be a little bit confusing at first not have a dedicated button for switching off the device, but when you get used to it you’ll soon forget that you turned a mobile off in any other way. In all honesty, it’s just a case of familiarity. When you get used to the controls, and you remember how to plug things in and how to activate all of the different functions, you don’t forget. It just becomes part of Apple’s user-friendly and intuitive design.</span></p>
