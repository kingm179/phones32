<p>The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/sony-xperia-10-iv-5g-128gb-black">Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G</a> has been labelled as the “perfect companion for everyday life”. You might be wondering what exactly does that mean? Well, in this new handsets case, this means a long-lasting 5,000mAh battery great for long days of adventure, a 6.0” illuminating OLED display destined for streaming perfection, High-Resolution Audio for a concert-like listening experience and so much more. I put these claims to the test by taking this shiny new handset with me on a London day out (a very long one at that). Will this lightweight <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/sony-mobile-phone-deals">Sony</a> handset live up to the hype? Keep scrolling to find out.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1: 6.0” 21:9 Wide OLED Display&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>We all want a display that injects life into everything we do on our devices, whether that’s endless social media scrolling, streaming your favourite guilty pleasure TV show or even engaging in some quality gaming time. The 6.0” Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G display has a lot of cool features under its belt. To name a few a 21:9 FHD+ OLED TRILUMINOS Display for breathtaking colour and contrast and a 2520 x 1080 resolution for crystal clear visuals.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1:  Display Test </strong></h2>



<p>If you’re a film fanatic you’re probably used to heading to the likes of Youtube to check out the latest trailers that are fresh on the scene and to test the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G display I did just that. This time I watched the Woman Is King Trailer- a highly anticipated film due to be released in October 2022.</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1: Result&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="683" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10542" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-2.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>As soon as I hit play I was blown away by the magic the TRILUMINOS® display the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G had to offer. The truest golds, deepest greens and boldest purples were showcased and the large 6”0 screen size only added to the experience further. There is a reason why Sony are known for their expertise in remarkable displays. The handset also fitted comfortably in hand due to its compact design and super lightweight feel.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Triple Lens Rear Camera&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>An exceptional camera is a requirement for the majority of modern-day smartphone users (I mean how else will we snap all of our wonderful Instagram content?). This Sony device&#8217;s triple rear camera has been described as “feature-packed” and “breathtaking”. This camera set-up consists of a 16mm 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, a 27mm 12MP wide-angle lens and lastly a 54mm 8MP telephoto lens.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Camera Test</strong></h2>



<p>Since I spent the weekend exploring all the magic London has to offer from views to food, I thought this was the perfect opportunity to use the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G to capture it in all its glory.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Result</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gDJuObLpaV_9irrw2Do6nLAri7C2dHJqcEnwM5moUuC_2qDPq6ZrTME2VDvCdI1rlMy_ninlHb9yscbq_qtO_5uGZLxvzXkKxDwIdBa3K__eS-txTbKyeHxYmFl4814DZ0M9EkgLybUxSpw_iBXlwew" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Brick Lane in East London was my first stop, where I was hit with a beautiful range of colourful street art and graffiti which I just had to snap some photos of. The Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G effortlessly picked up all the vibrancy and light within the shot thanks to the trio of lenses and incredible LED flash. If posting art across your social media platforms is your thing, this is the perfect camera for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My second stop with the Sony Xperia by my side was the South African restaurant Shaka Zulu in Camden Market. Thanks to Optical Image Stabilisation, Night Mode and Auto HDR, my photos were blur-free, stable and clear despite the restaurant&#8217;s very low lighting conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the beautiful colours of the dishes were picked up at exceptional quality, and again the incredible LED flash illuminated the shot efficiently. A photo so good you can almost taste it. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10537" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-150x113.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1.jpg 1249w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2><strong>Feature 3: Powerful 5,000mAh Battery For All Day Power&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>A long-lasting battery is essential for any long day out, I mean there’s music to be played, photos to be taken and videos to be streamed. Thankfully the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G is equipt with a large capacity 5,000mAh battery giving users much-needed ‘all-day power’.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3: Battery Test </strong></h2>



<p>Leaving my house at 11 AM with the Sony handset by my side, and not getting back home until 11 PM that night, gave this handset a solid 12 hours test to see if the claim of ‘all-day power’ had some proof behind it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3: Result</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="447" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-1024x447.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10544" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-150x65.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-300x131.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-768x335.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-1024x447.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-1536x670.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-2048x894.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Starting on a 100% charge and after 12 hours of photo-taking, bursts of gaming and music-playing, the Xperia device&#8217;s 5,000mAh battery only dropped by 12% &#8211; not bad at all for a full day&#8217;s work. Life with this smartphone means using a power bank won&#8217;t be a regular occurrence at all. Looks like the ‘All Day Power’ statement has proof in the pudding after all.</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 4: Premium Sound&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Sony and premium sound come hand in hand. For a truly authentic listening experience, the 10 IV 5G is equipt with High-Resolution Audio (which gives you premium sound), 360 Reality Audio Upmix (which works with local audio files and streaming services to further enhance your listening experience) and a 3.5mm audio jack (perfect for on the go streaming).&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 4:  Sound Test </strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" data-id="10543"  src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10543" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-80x80.jpg 80w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</figure>



<p>As a music lover, I was excited to test out the audio quality on this device. The golden question was would the experience be mini-concert worthy and premium? To answer this burning question I headed to Spotify, pressed a feel-good song and listened away.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 4: Result</strong></h2>



<p>The audio quality from this handset was one of a kind. The 360 Reality Upmix feature in particular created an immersive experience in real-time. Achieving premium quality sound on this device is done with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately I found the 10 IV 5G very impressive. Not only were the acclaimed stand-out features regarding the display, camera, sound and battery true, but they actually exceeded my expectations. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you’re a loyal <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">iPhone</a> user you’ll know the exciting feeling of unboxing a brand new iPhone very well. I mean it feels pretty great, an unmarked flawless screen, sleek body and a camera roll nice and empty ready for you to fill up. But there&#8217;s always one main question that hits you shortly after, ‘do I invest in AppleCare+ or reliable mobile phone protection accessories instead?’. Well, Fonehouse is here to answer your dilemma so your pondering ends here.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>AppleCare+</strong></h2>



<p>When it comes to precious technology, some of us are more accident-prone than others. So when AppleCare+ first hit the scene in 2011 there was a fair amount of buzz around it. If you’ve been living under a rock and you don&#8217;t know what AppleCare+ is, it is Apple&#8217;s own extended warranty and technical support plan for their devices. </p>



<h2><strong>What Does AppleCover Cover?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="395" height="464" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/apple-care-plus-phone.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10437" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/apple-care-plus-phone-128x150.jpg 128w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/apple-care-plus-phone-255x300.jpg 255w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/apple-care-plus-phone.jpg 395w" sizes="(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px" /></figure>



<p>Standard AppleCare+ for iPhones includes a warranty cover of up to two incidents of accidental damage every 12 months. With this cover, you’ll receive discounted repair fees compared to what you would pay without an extended warranty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AppleCare+ With Theft and Loss version of this extended warranty plan does what it says on the tin, and offers everything standard Apple Care+ does but with theft and loss scenarios included.</p>



<h2><strong>Is AppleCare Worth it?</strong></h2>



<p>After reading all that AppleCare+ has to offer above it might seem like a bargain, however in the long run this can be quite expensive as the cost varies depending on which iPhone model you have. Here’s a quick rundown on the approximate prices:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>iPhone Model</strong></td><td><strong>AppleCare+</strong></td><td><strong>AppleCare+ with Theft &amp; Loss</strong></td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 13 (128GB)</td><td>£139/yr</td><td>£189/yr</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 13 Pro (128GB)</td><td>£189/yr</td><td>£239/yr</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 12 (64GB)</td><td>£139/yr</td><td>£189/yr</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 11 (64GB)</td><td>£139/yr</td><td>£189/yr</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone SE (64GB)</td><td>£69/yr</td><td>£119/yr</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>If you still want to protect your phone without having to fork out a lot of money on AppleCare+ protection don&#8217;t worry, high-quality <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories">mobile accessories</a> are a great option instead, and Fonehouse has a bunch of them. </p>



<h2><strong>Screen Protectors</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-13-screen-protector.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10435" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-13-screen-protector-80x80.png 80w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-13-screen-protector-150x150.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-13-screen-protector-300x300.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-13-screen-protector.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>



<p>A top-quality <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/screen-protector">screen protector</a> is a barrier between your handset and the world. With this piece of mobile accessory gear on even during the clumsiest moments, your screen should remain intact. With screen protectors ranging from £8.99 to £9.99, Fonehouse provides a cheap solution to making your phone screen last longer. </p>



<h2><strong>Mobile Phone Cases&nbsp;</strong></h2>

Fonehouse has a range of cheap <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/mobile-phone-cases">phone cases</a> up for grabs for a variety of different phones ranging from iPhone to <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsung</a>. P.S they’re pretty stylish too. </p>

<p>When <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/honor-mobile-phone-deals">HONOR</a> create handsets they go big. Whether that’s a premium sophisticated design, advanced camera system, first-class display or maybe all of those features combined -well at least that&#8217;s the case for the HONOR Magic4 Pro. This flagship handset has been a highly anticipated one, and we at <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/">Fonehouse</a> were lucky enough to get our hands on one early. We’ve selected three stand-out features of the handset, put them to the test, recorded the result and even added a top tip in there as a bonus. Your decision on whether to take the plunge and get this new HONOR handset made easy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1: First-Time Combination First-Class Display</strong></h2>



<p>There’s a lot of hype surrounding the HONOR Magic4 Pro 6.81” 120Hz adaptive LTPO OLED display. Some phrases that have been thrown out there to describe it are: “truly immersive” “exclusive” and “first-class”. On paper this display seems pretty cool, I mean it&#8217;s quad-curved designed, has a DCI-P3 wide colour gamut and is IMAX ENHANCED certified. Hmm seems pretty impressive right?</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1 Test: </strong></h2>



<p>What’s the one thing we pretty much all do on our devices? Stream entertainment content of course! I headed to the likes of Youtube and Netflix to see if the HONOR Magic4 Pro display really brings visuals to life or not.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1 Result:</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10403" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>My first stop was Youtube to check out the trailer for the new Avatar: The Way of Water film due to be released later this year. The first thing I noticed was how beautifully in-depth the colours were on the screen. The deepest blues, browns and greens were featured paired with an impressive crystal clear quality. From this test, it’s obvious that the DCI-P3 wide colour gamut and IMAX enhanced certification features are paying off. This experience was like a mini-cinema in the palm of my hand. The “truly immersive” statement is true after all.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1 Tip:</strong></h2>



<p>With a screen as flawless as this, you need to make the most of all things entertainment. So my top tip would be to watch a big blockbuster on the handset! The quad-curved design in particular really does elevate the typical viewing experience so you’ll be in for a treat.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Ultra Fusion Photography</strong></h2>



<p>The advanced camera system behind the HONOR Magic4 Pro has been noted to be one of the handset&#8217;s top stand-out features. With this triple-lens setup (consisting of a 50MP wide lens, a 50MP ultra-wide lens and a 64MP Periscope Telephoto lens), users can effortlessly capture what they see, enjoy HDR photography due to a superior lens, and even enjoy a spectacular night mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2 Test:</strong></h2>



<p>I was curious to see if the HONOR Magic4 Pro camera was all it was made up to be, so I did the logical thing and explored the great outside with it (and by outside I mean I went for a fancy breakfast and snapped some pics of my food). Were the photos remarkably perfect and most importantly Instagram worthy? Well, keep scrolling to find out.</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2 Result:</strong></h2>

<p>I was impressed with the HONOR Magic4 Pro’s photography power. Not only were all the beautiful fine details picked up thanks to the ‘Advanced 7P Wide Camera’, but my shots were completely stable every time thanks to the handsets Flicker Sensor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10394" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-150x113.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Aside from snapping photos of food as you can see from above, I did capture some photos of sceneries too. Again this HONOR device pulled through with its HDR photography and 122° field of view on the Ultra Wide Angle lens, to give me incredible high-quality photos. In my book, this camera is definitely Instagram approved.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2 Tip:&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>In regards to this feature, my top tip is to actually get up and leave your house for once! The HONOR Magic4 Pro camera is simply too good to be sitting inside all day. Get up, explore and take wonderful photos along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3 GPU Turbo X: </strong></h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s start off with the basics, what actually is GPU Turbo X? GPU Turbo X uses AI rendering which enables your smartphone to keep high-quality visuals on-screen whilst lowering energy consumption at the same time. Included frame rate boosting technology paired with this consumption adjustment factor also enhances battery life and ultimately aims to improve the overall gaming experience. It’s time to put this cool feature to the test.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3 Test:</strong></h2>



<p>Okay so the method I took for this test is pretty obvious, I headed to the Google Play Store and downloaded a game -big shock I know. The particular game, I trialed out was ‘Race Master 3D- Car Racing’ for the lengthy duration of two hours.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3 Result:</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10404" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The effects of the GPU Turbo X feature were clearly evident to me. Despite gaming for a solid two hours straight the battery life on the HONOR Magic4 Pro remained consistently high, and the graphics were continually top-quality. Compared to gaming on other handsets, I found gaming on this device more hands-on, and the experience as a whole was more immersive and addictive (hence gaming for two hours straight). So if you’re a gaming fanatic out there you’re in luck, this HONOR handset is bound to elevate your experience to levels you’ve never reached before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3 Tip:</strong></h2>



<p>Maybe you’re an avid gamer and you already know all the hit games, but if you’re not I suggest you do some research on what’s popular right now in the world of Andriod gaming. Find a pick and try it out for yourself on the HONOR Magic4 Pro. See for yourself if it&#8217;s worth all the hype (big spoiler: it most definitely is).&nbsp;</p>





<p>After reading all the ins and outs regarding the features the HONOR Magic4 Pro has to offer from its beautiful large display to its remarkable photography power, I&#8217;m sure you’ll want to find the best money-saving deal too right? Well look no further Fonehouse has a bunch of <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/honor-magic4-pro-5g">fantastic deals</a> on this handset up for grabs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Apple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. The first product sold by Apple was the Apple I personal computer, and from there the company continued to develop various computers – including the original Macintosh. In the late 1980s, Wozniak and Jobs stepped back from the company – taking on separate ventures.</p>



<p>After a rocky few years in competition with Microsoft, Apple brought Steve Jobs back who guided Apple to profitability and introduced the likes of the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad.</p>



<p>Now we know Apple as one of the most successful tech companies in the world and as of January 2021, it was the most valuable company in the world.</p>



<h2>The iPhone</h2>



<p>Apple CEO, Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone in January 2007. The handset, which wouldn’t hit the shelves for another 6 months, was criticised as being too expensive for the market however looking back now we can see how the iPhone’s success condemned its critics&#8217; remarks.</p>



<p>Over the last 15 years, <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/evolution-of-the-iphone/">the iPhone has evolved</a> to welcome various new internet speeds – first 3G, then 4G and now 5G. We have witnessed a range of camera updates – including the launch of the selfie camera and launches of key features we know today such as Siri, location services, Apple Music and accessories such as AirPods.</p>



<h2>What is the Latest iPhone?</h2>

<p>The iPhone 13 range release saw praise for the updated camera and battery life. The iPhone 13 saw an increase in battery life of up to 99hrs, a 12MP camera and superfast 5G. Within the range is also the updated <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-pro-5g">iPhone 13 Pro</a> which featured the biggest Pro camera upgrade ever – with a 12MP Telephoto, Wide and Ultra-Wide camera.

<p>The iPhone range is the standard release of each iPhone – now we typically see four versions of new iPhones being released. The four are iPhone, iPhone Mini, iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max. Each handset features a range of exciting tech updates and new features.</p>



<p>The iPhone range contains plenty of exciting updates, and typically is priced at a lower point than its pro counterparts.</p>



<h3>iPhone Pro Range</h3>



<p>The iPhone Pro range takes the handset a little bit further in terms of camera quality and technical specifications. Apple defines its Pro models as the handset for those who want to get the most out of their device.</p>



<h3>iPhone Pro Max Range</h3>



<p>The iPhone Pro Max range typically has the exact same feature set as the iPhone Pro but in a bigger size. With the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, the Pro Max also has a larger battery capacity.</p>



<h3>iPhone SE Range</h3>



<p>The iPhone SE range is Apple’s mid-range device range and offers a whole host of features you would find on the flagship range but at a lower cost. The SE range is perfect for those looking to own an iPhone and experience a range of features without the higher price point.</p>



<h2>Which iPhone Has the Best Camera?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10218" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>Each iPhone release sees an improvement in camera quality – and the iPhone Pro ranges take that one step further. Therefore, currently, we can say that the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max have the best camera. Both models feature:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Dual 12MP/12MP front camera</strong></li><li><strong>Triple 12MP/12MP/12MP rear camera featuring a wide, telephoto and ultra-wide lens</strong></li><li><strong>4K Dolby Vision and HDR recording</strong></li></ul>



<h2>When Does the New iPhone Come Out?</h2>



<p>Typically, we can expect to see a new iPhone launched around September time each year – this has been the case for the past few years. We don’t know much about the next iPhone launch but we are excited to see what improvements Apple have up their sleeve.</p>



<h2>Which iPhone Should I Buy?</h2>



<h3>iPhone 13 Range</h3>



<p>The latest range from Apple features four models:</p>



<ul><li><strong>iPhone 13</strong></li><li><strong>iPhone 13 Mini</strong></li><li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro</strong></li><li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro Max</strong></li></ul>



<p>All four models see a huge upgrade from the previous device and have some of the best camera and battery technology available.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g">iPhone 13</a> features the most advanced dual-camera system ever seen on an iPhone, the fastest chip; A15 Bionic chipset and one of the biggest advances in battery life we’ve seen. With superfast 5G and a super durable and timeless design, this handset has impressed us all. You have various colour choices when it comes to the iPhone 13, including Midnight, Red, Blue, Pink and Starlight (white). The iPhone 13 also comes in a smaller size, the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-mini-5g">iPhone 13 Mini</a> – perfect for smaller hands and compact enough to fit in pockets and handbags – the Mini features all the same technology just in a handy size.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to elevate your handset that bit further, we recommend you try the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-pro-5g">iPhone 13 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-pro-max-5g">Pro Max</a>. If you enjoy taking photos on your device and need that little bit of extra battery life, we think the swish 13 Pro range is for you. You can impress your friends with the latest technology and take all the best images of your social life, landscapes, wildlife and more with the triple 12MP rear camera.</p>



<h3>iPhone 12 Range</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g">iPhone 12</a> was 2020’s flagship range and saw the introduction of a clean new design and a breadth of colourways. It was also the first time we saw the introduction of the iPhone Mini. The iPhone 12 range’s main updates included increased power and the introduction of 5G. In the iPhone 12 range we see:</p>



<ul><li><strong>iPhone 12</strong></li><li><strong>iPhone 12 Mini</strong></li><li><strong>iPhone 12 Pro</strong></li><li><strong>iPhone 12 Pro Max</strong></li></ul>



<p>Similar to the 13, the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini see a dual rear camera whereas the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-pro-5g">Pro and Pro Max</a> see a triple-lens rear camera. The differences between the standard and pro ranges remain similar – improved camera and battery life.</p>



<p>The iPhone 12 range features the A14 Bionic chip, therefore providing great speeds and power.</p>



<h3>iPhone 11</h3>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-11">iPhone 11,</a> we saw the very first Pro and Pro Max additions, as well as a change in screen size and camera improvements. To this day the iPhone 11 range remains a great choice for a powerful phone with great image quality.</p>



<p>You can get a whole host of colour options with the iPhone 11, including Black, White, Green, Yellow, Red and Purple.</p>



<h3>iPhone XR and XS</h3>



<p>Subsequent releases from the iPhone X are the XR and XS. The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-xr">iPhone XR</a> and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-xs">iPhone XS</a> were released at the same time – with the XR being a lower-cost version of the XS. There isn’t a massive difference between the two phones, but the XS features better screen quality, sleeker design and the inclusion of 3D touch.</p>



<h3>iPhone SE (2020)</h3>



<p>Finally, we have the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-se-2020">iPhone SE</a> (2020). This phone is perfect for someone on a budget who still wants to invest in an iPhone.

<p>When it comes to selecting a mobile network, affordability, reliability, and speed are three key areas people look for &#8211; 3 things Vodafone knocks out of the park. From flexible and cheap <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/network/vodafone-mobile-phone-deals">Vodafone mobile contracts</a> to Vodafone TV, it truly is a company that does it all. If you want a run down about Vodafone as a brand, what they’ve achieved, and what they have to offer their customers Q&amp;A style keep reading!</p>



<h2><strong>How Many Countries Does Vodafone Operate In?</strong></h2>



<p>Vodafone since its humble beginnings in 1984 has made a huge impact in the world of telecommunications. Currently, Vodafone operates across 21 countries over two geographical regions, Europe, and the rest of the world. These countries include Turkey, Albania, Tanzania, Greece, and many other beautiful hotspot destinations.</p>



<h2><strong>Exactly How Succesful Are Vodafone?</strong></h2>



<p>As you’ve probably guessed, Vodafone is hugely successful in what they do. In the majority of its operations, they are within the top 2 spots of the largest mobile operators, and they are Europe&#8217;s largest 5G network provider &#8211; giving users more of what they enjoy, at fasters speeds. Vodafone is also known for being the best mobile network for people looking for varied and affordable data bundles as well as unlimited 5G.</p>



<h2><a></a><strong>What Are Vodafone’s Network Speeds like?</strong></h2>



<p>Each year Vodafone aims to become bigger and better than ever. This means improved network speeds, increased reliability, and even stronger 5G &#8211; a company that is always striving for greatness. One thing Vodafone has covered is providing its users with super-speedy access to content. The <a href="https://www.vodafone.co.uk/cs/groups/public/documents/webcontent/vfcon111128.pdf">2021 UK Mobile Performance Review </a>by Root Metrics, reported that Vodafone was 1 out of 2 network providers that provided download speeds faster than 50 Mbps. Whether you’re a person who loves to open 10 internet tabs at a time or a person who’s constantly calling their friends, Vodafone is a network that always aims to support you within your ventures.</p>



<p>5G is the future. A great 5G provider should allow strong connection in heavily populated areas, faster downloads, flawless streaming, HD video calling and no lagging &#8211; ultimately making the usage of your device more fluent. Since 2020 Vodafone has shown massive improvements within its 5G mobile data service. In 2021 it&#8217;s every day 5G availability improved across all 13 of its cities, and the network had increased median download speeds in a total of 11 cities. In the world of Vodafone, losing connection, long loading speeds and lagging are simply a thing in the past.</p>



<h2><strong>How do I Keep My Mobile Number On Vodafone?</strong></h2>



<p>You want to make the big switch over to the trustee Vodafone network, but you want to keep your existing mobile number- we’re here to help you out a bit. If you’re joining Vodafone from another network provider, you’ll need three things: your temporary Vodafone number, the number you want to keep and a Porting Authorisation Code (PAC code). To get this code, all you’ll need to do is text the word ‘PAC’ to the number ‘65075’, this will request your code from your current network provider free of charge (this code typically lasts 30 days, and after this duration, you’ll have to request a new code). Upon securing your new Vodafone contract, you’ll just need to provide them with this PAC code, and then Vodafone will do all the work and make the transfer to switch over your device from your temp number to the mobile number you want. Once your number has been transferred over to Vodafone, you might temporarily lose service and you might need to turn your device on and off to complete the process.</p>



<p>Alternatively, if you would like to take a new number, and cancel your old contract, you’ll need a Service Termination Authorisation Code (STAC Code). To get this code from your existing provider you’ll just need to text the word: ‘STAC’ to the number ‘75075’ &#8211; again completely free of charge and give this code to Vodafone to sort out on your behalf.</p>

<p>Do you need help deciding which Samsung mobile is best for you? Well, look no further because our Samsung buying guide will help find the best Samsung mobile phone for you, and our best deals available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When choosing a new mobile phone, you need to consider what functionalities are most important to you, is it 5G connectivity, screen size, storage, camera quality, or all the above? There are many features to choose from. Maybe you must be on trend and have the latest technology at your fingertips. No matter how you use your mobile phone the Samsung range has something on offer for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Samsung Brand&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals" target="_blank">Samsung</a> is a well-known, distinguished, household name, and are a brand we trust for the quality of their products. Their huge range of mobile phones are popular for their superior designs and innovative features. This year is due to be an amazing year for Samsung as they release their latest handset. The tech giant is expected to set a new precedent in the mobile industry.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Which Samsung Phone is Best for Me? &nbsp;</h2>



<p>Samsung have a wide range of mobile phones and smartphones available and the best phone for you is dependent on which features you will get the most out of. If you are an avid photographer, the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-5g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G</a> has an impressive 106 megapixels main camera, which is able to capture high-quality images.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you take more videos, then look for a smartphone which has at least a 4k video, some of the newer smartphones have an 8k video available which is 16 times the resolution of Full HD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Samsung <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-5g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Galaxy Z</a> and Samsung <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-5g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Galaxy S</a> ranges also have remarkable optical image stabilisation for smooth, slick videos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phone memory and storage goes hand in hand with taking photos and videos, so make sure whichever smartphone you choose has sufficient memory for your needs. The more Gigabytes (GB) your phone has the more you’ll be able to store. A typical smartphone user will feel that 64GB phone memory is sufficient, although some prefer to choose between 128GB and 256GB.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If streaming and connectivity is more your thing, look for a 5G enabled phone. 5G is the fifth generation of mobile networks offering fewer delays when using your phone and accessing web content as well as significantly faster download and uploads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
