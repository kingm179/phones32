<h2>Who is Xiaomi?</h2>



<p>Founded in 2010, Xiaomi is one of the newest phone brands- offering high quality handsets at low prices. Despite the company’s youth, Xiaomi already has presence in over 100 countries and regions.</p>



<h2>Which Xiaomi Phone is Best for Me?</h2>



<p>Xiaomi has some fabulous offerings and deciding which Xiaomi phone is best all comes down to what you’re looking for. Is your priority a killer camera that will capture perfect pics day and night? Or perhaps your dream phone is one with lightning-fast charging capabilities, or impressive battery life? You might be a mobile phone gamer whose top criteria is screen size and quality? Or perhaps you’re looking for the best phone display for your eye health?</p>



<p>Whatever you’re looking for in a phone, we can help you to find the perfect Xiaomi device to fit it.</p>



<h2>Which is the Latest Xiaomi Phone?</h2>



<p>Xiaomi’s latest flagship is the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/xiaomi-12-5g">Xiaomi 12</a>, with its variants such as the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/xiaomi-12-pro-5g">Xiaomi 12 Pro</a> . Both the Xiaomi 12 and Xiaomi 12 Pro boast the new super powerful Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 chip and a 50MP main camera.</p>



<h2>Which Xiaomi Phone has the Best Camera?</h2>



<p>Xiaomi certainly delivers when it comes to cameras, with many of their handsets boasting triple and quad rear cameras. However, our pick for best Xiaomi phone for camera is the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/xiaomi-mi-11-5g">Xiaomi Mi 11</a>.</p>

<p>SIM free phones are a brilliant choice for those who don’t like being tied to phone contracts, or who like to switch up their phone regularly. If you’re interested in purchasing a SIM-free handset, this easy-to-read guide will help you to make an informed decision.</p>



<h2>What is SIM Free?</h2>



<p>To understand what SIM free is, it’s helpful to first understand what a SIM card is. SIM stands for subscriber identity module, and it’s a computer chip that connects you and identifies you to your network, as well as containing information like your phone number.</p>



<p>A SIM free phone is exactly what it sounds like, it’s a phone that comes without a SIM card.</p>



<p>This means you can purchase your own SIM card separately or even insert a SIM card from your old phone. It also means that you buy your phone upfront rather than through a pay monthly contract.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img width="1024" height="731" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Phones-1024x731.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10248" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Phones-150x107.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Phones-300x214.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Phones-768x549.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Phones-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Phones-1536x1097.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SIM-Free-Phones-2048x1463.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>How Do SIM Free Phones Work?</h2>



<p>With a SIM free handset you simply insert your SIM into your chosen phone. There are then three types of SIM only contract you can opt for. These are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Pay As You Go SIMs</strong>: The data, minutes and texts on these SIM cards are topped up by the user whenever needed. This is a great cost-effective option if you’re someone who doesn’t use their phone much. However, if you, like many of us, use your phone a lot, the below options might be better for you.</li><li><strong>Contract SIMs</strong>: With this option you sign a contract which lasts for an agreed amount of time. During this time, you pay a certain monthly amount of money for a certain monthly amount of data, texts and minutes.</li><li><strong>Pay Monthly SIMs</strong>: Similar to the above option, except your contract rolls over every month. This gives you more freedom as you can cancel your contract 30 days in advance of the next rollover if needed.</li></ul>



<h2>Can You Put Any SIM in a SIM Free Phone?</h2>



<p>Not quite. Firstly, your SIM card must be the appropriate size for your handset. Older phones tend to use mini (standard) size SIMs whilst newer phones generally use micro or nano SIMs.</p>



<p>There are also two types of SIM free phone. Network locked phones are for those who wish to change their handset but not their pay monthly deal as these phones will only work with SIMs from a particular network. On the other hand, unlocked phones will accept SIMs from any network as long as it is the correct size.</p>

<h2>Why Buy a SIM Free Phone</h2>



<p>There are several reasons to choose a SIM free handset, such as:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Travel friendly</strong>: If you are someone who travels abroad a lot, a SIM free phone can come in handy. This is because you can switch out your SIM card for one available in the country you are visiting, enabling you to make calls and send texts in that country.</li><li><strong>Cost effective</strong>: Although SIM free phones have a higher up-front cost for the handset itself, many people save money in the long term. Especially because shopping for your phone and contract separately enables you to find the best deal.</li><li><strong>Freedom</strong>: With a SIM free phone, you can choose whichever network provider you like. And you won’t have any locked features or network apps.</li><li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: You can change your phone whenever you like.</li><li><strong>High resale value</strong>: When changing your phone, you can sell your old SIM free phone for a great price thanks to its open compatibility.</li><li><strong>Less stress over credit checks: </strong>If you have a lower than average credit score, buying SIM free is a great option for you as the credit checks can be less rigorous- particularly with a Pay As You Go SIM only contract.</li></ul>

<p>With so many options out there to choose from it can be tricky to know the best <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">iPhone</a> to buy. But, you need not worry as our iPhone buying guide has everything you need to find the best iPhone model for you and your needs.</p>



<p>Whether you’re looking for the latest technology, camera quality and battery life, or simply looking for the best iPhone that is value for money – we have something for everyone.</p>



<p>There are a variety of things to consider when choosing a new phone; and first of all, you need to consider what functionalities you most desire. There are a few things you may want to think about before starting your purchasing journey such as whether you want 5G connectivity, whether you need the latest camera or technology on the market or whether you simply just want the most on-trend handset available. Whatever it is that you’re looking for, there will certainly be an iPhone for you.</p>



<h2>The Apple Brand</h2>

<p>Apple was founded in 1976 by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne. The first product sold by Apple was the Apple I personal computer, and from there the company continued to develop various computers – including the original Macintosh. In the late 1980s, Wozniak and Jobs stepped back from the company – taking on separate ventures.</p>



<p>After a rocky few years in competition with Microsoft, Apple brought Steve Jobs back who guided Apple to profitability and introduced the likes of the iMac, iPod, iPhone and iPad.</p>



<p>Now we know Apple as one of the most successful tech companies in the world and as of January 2021, it was the most valuable company in the world.</p>



<h2>The iPhone</h2>



<p>Apple CEO, Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone in January 2007. The handset, which wouldn’t hit the shelves for another 6 months, was criticised as being too expensive for the market however looking back now we can see how the iPhone’s success condemned its critics&#8217; remarks.</p>



<p>Over the last 15 years, <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/evolution-of-the-iphone/">the iPhone has evolved</a> to welcome various new internet speeds – first 3G, then 4G and now 5G. We have witnessed a range of camera updates – including the launch of the selfie camera and launches of key features we know today such as Siri, location services, Apple Music and accessories such as AirPods.</p>



<h2>What is the Latest iPhone?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="480" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-13-hacks-1-1024x480.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10185" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-13-hacks-1-150x70.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-13-hacks-1-300x141.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-13-hacks-1-768x360.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-13-hacks-1-1024x480.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/iphone-13-hacks-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The latest iPhone is the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g">iPhone 13 range</a> – featuring the iPhone 13, iPhone 13 mini, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p>



<p>The iPhone 13 range release saw praise for the updated camera and battery life. The iPhone 13 saw an increase in battery life of up to 99hrs, a 12MP camera and superfast 5G. Within the range is also the updated <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-pro-5g">iPhone 13 Pro</a> which featured the biggest Pro camera upgrade ever – with a 12MP Telephoto, Wide and Ultra-Wide camera. The camera system also offers night mode, 4K Dolby Vision and HDR recording.</p>

<p>The iPhone range is the standard release of each iPhone – now we typically see four versions of new iPhones being released. The four are iPhone, iPhone Mini, iPhone Pro and iPhone Pro Max. Each handset features a range of exciting tech updates and new features.</p>



<p>The iPhone range contains plenty of exciting updates, and typically is priced at a lower point than its pro counterparts.</p>



<h3>iPhone Pro Range</h3>



<p>The iPhone Pro range takes the handset a little bit further in terms of camera quality and technical specifications. Apple defines its Pro models as the handset for those who want to get the most out of their device.</p>



<h3>iPhone Pro Max Range</h3>



<p>The iPhone Pro Max range typically has the exact same feature set as the iPhone Pro but in a bigger size. With the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, the Pro Max also has a larger battery capacity.</p>



<h3>iPhone SE Range</h3>



<p>The iPhone SE range is Apple’s mid-range device range and offers a whole host of features you would find on the flagship range but at a lower cost. The SE range is perfect for those looking to own an iPhone and experience a range of features without the higher price point.</p>



<h2>Which iPhone Has the Best Camera?</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10218" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/theregisti-wbDsOAMynRo-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>Each iPhone release sees an improvement in camera quality – and the iPhone Pro ranges take that one step further. Therefore, currently, we can say that the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max have the best camera. Both models feature:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Dual 12MP/12MP front camera</strong></li><li><strong>Triple 12MP/12MP/12MP rear camera featuring a wide, telephoto and ultra-wide lens</strong></li><li><strong>4K Dolby Vision and HDR recording</strong></li></ul>



<h2>When Does the New iPhone Come Out?</h2>



<p>Typically, we can expect to see a new iPhone launched around September time each year – this has been the case for the past few years. We don’t know much about the next iPhone launch but we are excited to see what improvements Apple have up their sleeve.</p>



<h2>Which iPhone Should I Buy?</h2>



<h3>iPhone 13 Range</h3>



<p>The latest range from Apple features four models:</p>



<ul><li><strong>iPhone 13</strong></li><li><strong>iPhone 13 Mini</strong></li><li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro</strong></li><li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro Max</strong></li></ul>



<p>All four models see a huge upgrade from the previous device and have some of the best camera and battery technology available.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g">iPhone 13</a> features the most advanced dual-camera system ever seen on an iPhone, the fastest chip; A15 Bionic chipset and one of the biggest advances in battery life we’ve seen. With superfast 5G and a super durable and timeless design, this handset has impressed us all. You have various colour choices when it comes to the iPhone 13, including Midnight, Red, Blue, Pink and Starlight (white). The iPhone 13 also comes in a smaller size, the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-mini-5g">iPhone 13 Mini</a> – perfect for smaller hands and compact enough to fit in pockets and handbags – the Mini features all the same technology just in a handy size.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to elevate your handset that bit further, we recommend you try the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-pro-5g">iPhone 13 Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-pro-max-5g">Pro Max</a>. If you enjoy taking photos on your device and need that little bit of extra battery life, we think the swish 13 Pro range is for you. You can impress your friends with the latest technology and take all the best images of your social life, landscapes, wildlife and more with the triple 12MP rear camera.</p>



<h3>iPhone 12 Range</h3>



<p>The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g">iPhone 12</a> was 2020’s flagship range and saw the introduction of a clean new design and a breadth of colourways. It was also the first time we saw the introduction of the iPhone Mini. The iPhone 12 range’s main updates included increased power and the introduction of 5G. In the iPhone 12 range we see:</p>



<ul><li><strong>iPhone 12</strong></li><li><strong>iPhone 12 Mini</strong></li><li><strong>iPhone 12 Pro</strong></li><li><strong>iPhone 12 Pro Max</strong></li></ul>



<p>Similar to the 13, the iPhone 12 and 12 Mini see a dual rear camera whereas the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-pro-5g">Pro and Pro Max</a> see a triple-lens rear camera. The differences between the standard and pro ranges remain similar – improved camera and battery life.</p>



<p>The iPhone 12 range features the A14 Bionic chip, therefore providing great speeds and power.</p>



<h3>iPhone 11</h3>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-11">iPhone 11,</a> we saw the very first Pro and Pro Max additions, as well as a change in screen size and camera improvements. To this day the iPhone 11 range remains a great choice for a powerful phone with great image quality.</p>



<p>You can get a whole host of colour options with the iPhone 11, including Black, White, Green, Yellow, Red and Purple.</p>



<h3>iPhone XR and XS</h3>



<p>Subsequent releases from the iPhone X are the XR and XS. The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-xr">iPhone XR</a> and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-xs">iPhone XS</a> were released at the same time – with the XR being a lower-cost version of the XS. There isn’t a massive difference between the two phones, but the XS features better screen quality, sleeker design and the inclusion of 3D touch.</p>



<h3>iPhone SE (2020)</h3>



<p>Finally, we have the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-se-2020">iPhone SE</a> (2020). This phone is perfect for someone on a budget who still wants to invest in an iPhone.

<p>Do you need help deciding which Samsung mobile is best for you? Well, look no further because our Samsung buying guide will help find the best Samsung mobile phone for you, and our best deals available.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>When choosing a new mobile phone, you need to consider what functionalities are most important to you, is it 5G connectivity, screen size, storage, camera quality, or all the above? There are many features to choose from. Maybe you must be on trend and have the latest technology at your fingertips. No matter how you use your mobile phone the Samsung range has something on offer for everyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>The Samsung Brand&nbsp;</h2>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals" target="_blank">Samsung</a> is a well-known, distinguished, household name, and are a brand we trust for the quality of their products. Their huge range of mobile phones are popular for their superior designs and innovative features. This year is due to be an amazing year for Samsung as they release their latest handset. The tech giant is expected to set a new precedent in the mobile industry.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Which Samsung Phone is Best for Me? &nbsp;</h2>



<p>Samsung have a wide range of mobile phones and smartphones available and the best phone for you is dependent on which features you will get the most out of. If you are an avid photographer, the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-5g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Galaxy S22 Ultra 5G</a> has an impressive 106 megapixels main camera, which is able to capture high-quality images.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you take more videos, then look for a smartphone which has at least a 4k video, some of the newer smartphones have an 8k video available which is 16 times the resolution of Full HD.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Samsung <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-5g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Galaxy Z</a> and Samsung <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s20-fe-5g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Galaxy S</a> ranges also have remarkable optical image stabilisation for smooth, slick videos.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Phone memory and storage goes hand in hand with taking photos and videos, so make sure whichever smartphone you choose has sufficient memory for your needs. The more Gigabytes (GB) your phone has the more you’ll be able to store. A typical smartphone user will feel that 64GB phone memory is sufficient, although some prefer to choose between 128GB and 256GB.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If streaming and connectivity is more your thing, look for a 5G enabled phone. 5G is the fifth generation of mobile networks offering fewer delays when using your phone and accessing web content as well as significantly faster download and uploads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Which Is the Latest Samsung Phone? &nbsp;</h2>

The Samsung Galaxy S22 is the latest in the S series, and boasts an Ultra and Plus model.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Samsung Galaxy Z Series&nbsp;</h3>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="876" height="400" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/galaxy-Z-series-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9700" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/galaxy-Z-series-1-150x68.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/galaxy-Z-series-1-300x137.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/galaxy-Z-series-1-768x351.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/galaxy-Z-series-1.jpg 876w" sizes="(max-width: 876px) 100vw, 876px" /></figure>



<p>The Samsung Galaxy Z series differs from other series’ as it is Samsung’s line of foldable smartphones. There are multiple different handsets featured in the Z series, including the Flip and Fold models. The main difference between the Z Flip and Fold models, is how they fold. In August 2021, Samsung launched the latest handsets in the Z series; the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold3 and Flip3.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Overall, the best series for you depends on what you want from your handset. For those on a budget, the A Series offer you a great specification for an affordable price. However, if you are looking for a mid to high-range handset, the S Series may be better suited and offers various specifications based on your preferences.

<p>Over the years, Samsung have become a particularly popular household name. With so many products we use daily, they are a brand we trust for their design and quality, and they never disappoint. Samsung are now one of the largest producers of electronic devices and continue to be at the forefront of people’s minds when looking to upgrade their smartphones.</p>



<p>At Fonehouse, we know our customers love the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsung</a> brand, as do we. It is trusted, reliable and innovative – so, what is the history of Samsung phones and where did it all begin?</p>



<h2 id="where-was-samsung-founded">Where was Samsung founded?</h2>



<p>Samsung was founded in 1938 in Daegu, South Korea, and was originally known as a grocery trader. The Samsung brand continually changed with the times, however, moving into the electronics sector in the late ’60s. This is when they started manufacturing black and white televisions.</p>



<p>Following the opening of a new development centre in Poland in 2000, Samsung moved into the development of digital TV, eventually making the move into the world of smartphones in the late noughties.</p>



<p>Samsung’s first foray into the world of mobile telecommunications happened a lot earlier however, pioneering the development of mobile phones as early as the 1980s.</p>



<h2 id="when-was-the-first-samsung-phone-released">When was the first Samsung phone released?</h2>



<p>In 1985 the first-ever Samsung phone, an in-car only cell phone, the SC-1000 was released. Sadly, the phone wasn’t a massive success with consumers; the model was plagued with tech issues. The mixed reception to the SC-1000 spurred the Korean-based manufacturer on as they invested heavily in research and development. This culminated in the launch of the Samsung brand’s first fully mobile telephone, the Samsung SH-100.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="460" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.jpeg" alt="Samsung SH-100" class="wp-image-9661" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-150x115.jpeg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1-300x230.jpeg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/1.jpeg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>The Samsung SH-100 boasted several ground-breaking advancements and was also the first mobile phone to be manufactured in Korea. Following the blockbuster launch of its flagship phone, Samsung went from strength to strength, continually thriving in the highly competitive mobile phone market.</p>



<h2 id="moving-with-the-times">Moving with the times</h2>



<p>Between the late 1980s and the millennium, Samsung expanded its mobile phone range and customer offering. They released their first colour mobile phone, the SCH-X430 model, with an LCD colour screen, truly ground-breaking for the time.</p>



<p>Technology has developed at an unprecedented rate since the start of the millennium, and Samsung have continued to rise to the challenge and deliver well designed, high-quality products that withstand the test of time. From touch screens to Flip screens, Ultra and Plus models, Samsung have developed products with consumer needs and usability in mind.</p>



<h2 id="when-was-the-first-samsung-smartphone-made">When was the first Samsung smartphone made?</h2>



<p>Samsung’s first smartphone was the original Samsung Galaxy released way back on June 29<sup>th</sup> in 2009. The Samsung Galaxy GT-17500 boasted cutting edge technology that offered quad-band GSM and tri-band HSDPA.<a id="_msocom_1"></a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="580" height="227" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SamsungGalaxyGTI7500LBellManualUserGuideSpecsOverview-1.jpeg" alt="Samsung Galaxy GT-17500" class="wp-image-9663" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SamsungGalaxyGTI7500LBellManualUserGuideSpecsOverview-1-150x59.jpeg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SamsungGalaxyGTI7500LBellManualUserGuideSpecsOverview-1-300x117.jpeg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/SamsungGalaxyGTI7500LBellManualUserGuideSpecsOverview-1.jpeg 580w" sizes="(max-width: 580px) 100vw, 580px" /></figure>



<p>Running off the then relatively new Android operating system (OS), this model pioneered the Samsung Galaxy line of devices, and helped shape and revolutionise how we use our mobile phones today. Samsung have since excelled in the Android (OS) market.</p>



<p>For over a decade, Samsung have expanded their Galaxy S smartphone range as they have developed new and innovative models, they do not hold back when it comes to design and user capabilities.</p>



<p>Their most recent launch in the S range was the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g">Samsung Galaxy S21</a>; 5G, triple-lens camera for high-resolution, professional images, built-in stereo speakers, and a long-lasting battery are to name only a few of the top features this high specification device has to offer.</p>



<h2 id="samsung-phones-2022-the-future-of-samsung-mobiles">Samsung phones 2022: The Future of Samsung mobiles</h2>



<p>2022 is an exciting year for Samsung. They have the expected arrival of the successor to the S21, the next big Android phone, this is rumoured to be released in February 2022, with a Plus and an Ultra model also rumoured.</p>



<p>Whilst they are known for their top of the market, high-end phones, Samsung have lines in all areas across the market. Their Galaxy A range is ideal for those looking for an affordable handset with a huge range of modern features. Their <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsung Galaxy A10</a> model in particular gives appeal to those customers.</p>



<p>Samsung have also brought the very impressive <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-3-5g">Samsung Galaxy Z</a> range to market, bringing full-sized smartphones which fold away to a more manageable size, making them easier to store in pockets. The Galaxy Z models are compact, foldable, and water-resistant. Samsung have really listened to their customers when developing this eye-catching model, showcasing their innovative designs.</p>

<p>Your handset should last you for several years – after all, you expect this when they cost a good amount of money upfront. However, it is important to remember, as with anything you purchase that you do need to look after your device to ensure its longevity.</p>



<p>There are various things you can do to actually extend the life of your <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals">mobile phone</a>, and in this guide, we have pulled together our top tips on looking after either your <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">iPhone</a> or <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/samsung-mobile-phone-deals">Samsung</a> device to ensure it lasts longer before you need to replace it.</p>



<p>If you do need to get your phone repaired, you’re in luck as in our Fonehouse stores we have a phone repair service – so you can get even longer out of your device! Find your nearest store with our <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/store-finder">store finder.</a></p>



<h2>How to Make your Phone Battery Last Longer</h2>



<p>Over time phones naturally see their battery life decline. However, whilst this is normal you can actually slow this down.</p>



<p>Lithium-ion batteries (the ones used in smartphones) chemically age over time so as the years go by they hold less charge. Whilst this process is inevitable, did you know you could be doing things that speed the process up?</p>



<p>To maximise the battery life on your handset you should keep the battery charged to somewhere between 30% and 80%. Over 80% the battery can age faster – and the same for if it goes below 20%. Below 20% the battery draws out more current which makes the battery life decrease.</p>



<p><strong>When it comes to the iPhone, </strong>on iOS 13 and later you can actually enable a function called ‘Optimized Battery Charging’ which is designed to decrease battery ageing. This feature reduces the amount of time your iPhone spends fully charged so fully charging over 80% is delayed or not carried out. You can enable this function by going to <strong>Settings &gt;Battery &gt; Battery Health &gt; Switch on Optimized Battery Charging</strong>.</p>



<p>For those who are concerned about charging their iPhone to 100%, you need not worry – a full recharge isn’t the end of the world but fully recharging every time will shorten your device’s lifespan. Another top tip is to turn your phone off whilst charging, or at least try not to use it.</p>

<h2>How to Manage Battery Usage on iPhone</h2>



<p>Continuing with the battery theme, you can easily manage your device’s battery life by viewing the usage by each app in <strong>Settings &gt; Battery. </strong>Some apps drain your battery more than others, so you can use this information to cut down on those apps that drain your battery the most. Other than cutting down on battery draining apps you can also optimise battery life by:</p>



<ul><li>Turning your device’s brightness down or switching to Dark Mode.</li><li>Turn off background app refresh, this stops apps draining your battery when they are not even in use. Go to <strong>Settings &gt; General &gt; Background App Refresh &gt; Off.</strong></li><li>Turn off Location Services for apps that don’t require it. Go to <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy &gt; Location Services &gt; Change the chosen apps permission setting to Never.</strong></li><li>For apps that frequently send notifications you do not need, you can turn off push notifications in <strong>Settings &gt; Notifications. Tap the app and set Allow Notifications to Off.</strong></li><li>Use WiFi instead of cellular data whenever possible.</li><li>When you have poor mobile coverage, turn on Airplane mode.</li><li>Turn on Low Power Mode in <strong>Settings &gt; Battery</strong>.</li></ul>



<h2>How to Manage Battery Usage on Samsung</h2>



<p>On Samsung phones, you can follow a similar method to manage battery usage. Simply go to <strong>Settings &gt; Battery and device care &gt; Battery </strong>to view the usage by each app and then try to cut down on those that drain your battery. &nbsp;Additionally, you can do the following to cut down on battery usage even further:</p>



<ul><li>Switch to Dark Mode or turn down the phone’s brightness.</li><li>Select a sleep status for certain apps to prevent them running in the background by going to <strong>Battery &gt; See more &gt; Settings &gt; Sleeping apps &gt; Add to select apps you want in sleep status &gt; Add</strong></li><li>Turn off location services on apps that don’t need them by <strong>Holding the chosen app icon &gt; App info &gt; Permissions &gt; Location &gt; Deny</strong></li><li>Turning off push notifications when they are not needed by going to <strong>Settings &gt; Notifications &gt; See all &gt; apps that most recently sent you a notification. If you can&#8217;t find the app you want, tap Most recent &gt; All &gt; Search for the app &gt; When you&#8217;ve found your app, tap to turn it off.</strong></li><li>Use WiFi wherever possible.</li><li>Switch to Power Saving Mode.</li><li>Adjust your screen time out so that your device will go dark when not in use. You can do this in <strong>Apps &gt; Settings &gt; Display &gt; Screen Time Out</strong>.</li></ul>



<h2>Temperature</h2>



<p>Being exposed consistently to high temperatures can damage your phones battery life permanently. The same goes for extremely cold temperatures but this will only be temporary.</p>



<p>iPhone’s ideal temperature is 16° C to 22°C but they can work best at 0°C to 35° C. For Samsungs the best temperature is also 0°C to 35° C.</p>



<h2>How to Replace a Broken Battery</h2>



<p>Many people will decide to get a new phone when their battery starts to worsen. However, if you are looking for a cost-effective way to extend the lifespan of your iPhone or Samsung phone, replacing the battery could be your best solution.</p>



<h2>Updating the Operating System</h2>



<h2>iOS</h2>



<p>You may have heard through the grapevine updating your <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/os/ios-mobile-phone-deals">iOS</a> can cause problems for older iPhones, but this is simply not the case – in fact, it is the opposite. It is essential to update your iPhone’s operating system to fix bugs, security issues and to add new features. The purpose of an iOS update is to improve the overall performance of your device – including ensuring it works quicker. You can choose to automatically install iOS updates to your device so that you never forget!</p>



<h2>Samsung OS</h2>



<p>Updating your Samsung operating system as required is essential to expanding the lifespan of your device. It helps to solve problems, fix bugs and improves performance. You can keep your device up to date by switching on <strong>auto-update</strong> on Lollipop/KitKat devices or <strong>Download updates automatically</strong> on Marshmallow devices and above.</p>



<h2>Updating your Apps</h2>



<p>It is important that you look through your apps often and remove any that you no longer use – to save storage and prevent them using battery life in the background. It is also important to update the apps you do use – again, you can set this to automatic, so you don’t forget.</p>



<p>On Samsung devices you have the option to auto-disable apps that haven’t been used for 30 days in <strong>Battery &gt; See more &gt; toggle Auto disable unused apps.</strong></p>



<p>Whilst we’re on the topic of apps, it is important to remember not to force quit apps unless they are unresponsive. This is because your operating system will pause apps not in use and this uses less power than repeatedly quitting and re-opening them.</p>



<h2>Storage</h2>



<p>If you have noticed your phone slowing down, you might want to look at your storage capacity.</p>



<p>When iPhone’s storage gets full it can slow down the functions of the device. To free up storage delete any unwanted images, videos, files and documents or back them up to iCloud.</p>



<p>The same goes for Samsung phones, you want to make sure you are managing storage to ensure your phone is running to its best ability. Did you know old text messages and voicemails can take up storage too? Make sure to go through and delete these if you can.</p>



<h2>Delete your Cache</h2>



<p>Your phone will collect a lot of cached data over time that you don’t need. This can impact your phone’s memory so clearing it out occasionally can help to free up storage space and can improve overall performance.</p>



<p>There are a few different ways you can do this on an iPhone, and it might vary depending on your apps – but start by checking each app in the iPhone Storage section of your settings. You can click on each and see if there is an option to clear cache – if not, try uninstalling and reinstalling each app.</p>



<p>On a Samsung Device to clear app cache go to <strong>Settings &gt; Apps &gt; Click on an often-used app &gt; Storage &gt; Clear Cache</strong>.</p>



<h2>Accessories</h2>



<p>Choosing the right <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories">phone accessories</a> for your device can play a big part in its lifespan – make sure you invest in things such as a <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/screen-protector">screen protector</a> and a case to protect it from damage. When it comes to charging we do recommend only using the charger that came with your device or one that is certified as ‘Made for iPhone’ or ‘Samsung-approved’ depending on your device.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="685" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phone-accessories-1024x685.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-9056" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phone-accessories-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phone-accessories-300x201.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phone-accessories-768x514.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phone-accessories-1024x685.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phone-accessories-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/phone-accessories-2048x1371.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2>Cleaning your Charging Port</h2>



<p>Dust and dirt can easily make its way into your charging port, shine a light into the port and if you can see dust or dirt you need to give it a clean. You can do this using a toothpick to gently dislodge any grime that is in there.</p>



<p>We hope that with this guide you know everything you need to about better looking after your Samsung or iPhone and that you can increase the lifespan of your current device.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/best-sim-only-deals">SIM only deals</a> are very popular, and people choose them over a contract for many reasons. First of all, you can save quite a lot of money per month, and it gives you greater flexibility around when you can change your handset. The only downside is, you will have to pay for a handset upfront or use one you already have.</p>



<p>That being said, if you are smart about it, you can gain a lot from switching to a SIM only deal. If you aren’t sure a SIM only deal is the right choice for you, we have a range of other <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals">contract deals</a> you can look at.</p>



<h2>What is a SIM Only Deal?</h2>



<p>A SIM only deal is as simple as it sounds, it means you get a SIM deal with no handset. It can be a great way to get a good deal on data, texts and calls without paying a high contract each month – because you won’t be paying monthly for your device.</p>



<p>Traditionally, SIM only deals were Pay As You Go deals, however now there are Pay As You Go and Pay Monthly SIM only deals to choose from. SIM only pay monthly contracts tend to get you a lot more for your money however – if you are happy to sign up to a contract. These contracts are typically shorter than mobile phone contracts and start at around 12 months.</p>



<h2>How Do SIM Only Deals Work?</h2>



<p>With a SIM only deal you will pay a monthly fee like you do with a handset contract however it will be much cheaper as you don’t pay a handset monthly fee. So, for example our SIM only deals start from £6 per month.</p>



<p>With SIM only deal you get different data, minute and text allowances as you do with a phone contract. So, you need to make sure you are choosing the best one for you and your phone usage.</p>



<h2>How Much Data Will I Need on a SIM Only Deal</h2>



<p>Data is now one of the most important considerations to make when you are purchasing a mobile contract or SIM only deal. If you are someone who uses your phone out of the house a lot, away from Wi-Fi, and uses a lot of social media – you will likely want to consider a higher amount of data such as upwards of 30GB and preferably unlimited.</p>



<p>Even if you are someone who doesn’t use their phone much out of the house, you still want to consider having some data to use maps and other helpful apps.</p>



<h2>Getting the Most out of Your SIM Only Deal</h2>



<p>The best way you can get the most out of your SIM only deal, financially, is if you already own a handset and you don’t worry about having the latest model. On the other hand, you may want to purchase a new phone outright and then get a SIM only deal – this is also a good solution if you have the lump sum to do so.</p>



<p>We wouldn’t recommend a SIM only deal if you like to switch out your handset for the newest model every couple of years, as it can become expensive to pay outright for a new phone every 24 months. If this sounds like you, we would recommend looking at a pay monthly contract instead.</p>



<h2>Can I Use a SIM Only Deal If My Handset is Locked?</h2>



<p>Sometimes phones are locked to their network provider – so, for example your handset may be locked to Vodafone meaning you can only use a Vodafone SIM in it. However, once your previous contract has ended – which it must have done for you to take advantage of a SIM only deal, you can ask your provider to unlock your phone and then you are good to go.</p>



<p>Everyone is different when it comes to mobile phones, and the best deal for one isn’t always the best for another. Therefore, it is important to weight up whether SIM only is the best deal for you. If it is we have <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/best-sim-only-deals">plenty of deals for you to take a look at</a>! If not, have a browse of our equally as fantastic <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals">mobile phone deals</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>So, you’ve got your new <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g">iPhone 13</a>, you are excited to get started – but how do you actually go about setting it up? Don’t worry we’ve got you covered.</p>



<p>The first step is to unpackage your new phone, which we’re sure you will have done the second you got it! From there you want to turn on the phone and make sure you are setting it up over an internet connection or connected to a computer.</p>



<p>The best thing about iPhones is that if you already have one, or an iPad, you can transfer all of your data easily – and you can even do the same with an Android! Below, we’ll take you through how to do both of these.</p>



<h2>Before iPhone Set Up &nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are a few things you can do before you set up your new phone that can help it go as smoothly as possible. Make sure you have a Wi-Fi connection ready, so it is best to do this at home if you can!</p>



<p>Make sure to have your Apple ID and password to hand, if you don’t have one you can create one – you can also have your credit and debit cards to hand if you want to set up Apple pay at this point too!</p>



<p>If you are transferring from an old iPhone, now is your chance to make sure you have backed it up. If you have an Android, have this to hand.</p>



<p>Now, press and hold the side button until the Apple logo appears. If you have any issues at this point, plug the phone in as it may need charging.</p>



<p>If you are choosing to set up manually, you now have to select this option and the instructions will appear onscreen to guide you through the process. However, if not keep reading.</p>



<h2>How to Set Up a New iPhone Using Quick Start</h2>



<ol type="1"><li>If you have another iPhone, iPad or iPod touch you can get this device and use quick start. Bring the old and new devices together and follow onscreen prompts to copy over your settings, preferences and iCloud.</li><li>If you have iOS 12.4 or below, you’ll have to transfer the rest of your data from an iCloud backup.</li><li>If you have iOS 12.4 and above, this data will be wirelessly transferred from your existing device. Keep the devices together whilst this happens.</li><li>If you have vision impairments, you can triple click the side button to turn on the screen reader.</li></ol>



<h2>How to Set Up an iPhone 13 If You Have an Android</h2>



<p>If you currently have an <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/os/android-mobile-phone-deals">Android device</a>, you can also securely move data from this device to your new iPhone 13.</p>



<ol type="1"><li>On your Android device, download the ‘Move to iOS’ app.</li><li>On your iPhone 13, follow the usual setup steps and select ‘Move Data from Android’ when prompted on the data screen.</li><li>On your Android device, turn on Wi-Fi and open the Move to iOS app – follow the onscreen instructions and your data will be securely transferred.</li></ol>



<p>There you have it! You have set up your brand-new <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g">iPhone 13</a> or <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-pro-5g">iPhone 13 Pro</a> and are ready to make the most of all the amazing features. We hope you enjoy using your new iPhone.</p>
