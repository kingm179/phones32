<p><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/google-mobile-phone-deals">Google</a> are known for producing high-performing handsets which are full of speed, power and intelligent photography ability, and with their highly anticipated <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/google-pixel-6a-5g">Google Pixel 6a 5G</a> model going live for preorder on the 21st of July, the Pixel family is finally growing. Here is all the magic this 5G handset has to offer:</p>



<h2>Google Pixel 6a: All Day Power</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10572" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-150x84.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-300x169.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-768x432.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-battery-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>One of the worst things that can happen to any modern-day smartphone user is their phone inconveniently dying midway through the day, with not a charger in sight…. (a complete horror story we know). Well with the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/google-pixel-6a-5g">Google Pixel 6a’s</a> 4410 mAh long-lasting battery this won&#8217;t ever be an issue. Users are supplied with much-needed all-day power (24 hours+) and with the Extreme Battery Saver mode turned on, can even extend their battery life for up to 72 hours total. When you do in fact have to plug in and charge your device, this experience will be quick thanks to fast wired 18W charging. This is a smartphone that wants you to get up and go!</p>



<h2>Google Pixel 6a Design &amp; Display</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10571" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-150x84.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-300x169.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-768x432.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-design-display-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Looks aren’t everything but the design of the Google Pixel 6a 5G is pretty impressive. With 3 different colours up for grabs: Sage, Chalk and Charcoal, paired with a beautifully sleek exterior with rounded edges, no matter what colour option people go for they will be wowed. Also, the large 6.1” FHD+ OLED display featured on the device only adds to the premium aesthetic.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Google Pixel 6a Camera</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10583" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-150x84.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-camera1-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Lights, camera, action. It’s time for the juicy details about the camera included on this flagship handset. The rear of this device features a dual-lens set-up, consisting of a 12.2MP wide lens and a 12MP ultrawide lens. These lenses and added features like Face Unblur work effortlessly together to give users stable and blur-free shots. Magic Eraser gives users the ability to remove unwanted objects from images, and Real Tone captures the authenticity of all skin tones! All these cool features mentioned are Pixel Exclusives, so they’re completely one of a kind. Side note the selfie camera on this device is 8MP so it’s also great at giving you picture-perfect photos.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Google Pixel 6a: Protection &amp; Privacy</h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-protection1-1024x576.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10578" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-protection1-150x84.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-protection1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-protection1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-protection1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-protection1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/googlepixel6a-protection1-2048x1152.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

<p>The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/sony-xperia-10-iv-5g-128gb-black">Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G</a> has been labelled as the “perfect companion for everyday life”. You might be wondering what exactly does that mean? Well, in this new handsets case, this means a long-lasting 5,000mAh battery great for long days of adventure, a 6.0” illuminating OLED display destined for streaming perfection, High-Resolution Audio for a concert-like listening experience and so much more. I put these claims to the test by taking this shiny new handset with me on a London day out (a very long one at that). Will this lightweight <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/sony-mobile-phone-deals">Sony</a> handset live up to the hype? Keep scrolling to find out.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1: 6.0” 21:9 Wide OLED Display&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>We all want a display that injects life into everything we do on our devices, whether that’s endless social media scrolling, streaming your favourite guilty pleasure TV show or even engaging in some quality gaming time. The 6.0” Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G display has a lot of cool features under its belt. To name a few a 21:9 FHD+ OLED TRILUMINOS Display for breathtaking colour and contrast and a 2520 x 1080 resolution for crystal clear visuals.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1:  Display Test </strong></h2>



<p>If you’re a film fanatic you’re probably used to heading to the likes of Youtube to check out the latest trailers that are fresh on the scene and to test the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G display I did just that. This time I watched the Woman Is King Trailer- a highly anticipated film due to be released in October 2022.</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1: Result&nbsp;</strong></h2>

<p>As soon as I hit play I was blown away by the magic the TRILUMINOS® display the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G had to offer. The truest golds, deepest greens and boldest purples were showcased and the large 6”0 screen size only added to the experience further. There is a reason why Sony are known for their expertise in remarkable displays. The handset also fitted comfortably in hand due to its compact design and super lightweight feel.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Triple Lens Rear Camera&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>An exceptional camera is a requirement for the majority of modern-day smartphone users (I mean how else will we snap all of our wonderful Instagram content?). This Sony device&#8217;s triple rear camera has been described as “feature-packed” and “breathtaking”. This camera set-up consists of a 16mm 8MP ultra-wide-angle lens, a 27mm 12MP wide-angle lens and lastly a 54mm 8MP telephoto lens.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Camera Test</strong></h2>



<p>Since I spent the weekend exploring all the magic London has to offer from views to food, I thought this was the perfect opportunity to use the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G to capture it in all its glory.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Result</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/gDJuObLpaV_9irrw2Do6nLAri7C2dHJqcEnwM5moUuC_2qDPq6ZrTME2VDvCdI1rlMy_ninlHb9yscbq_qtO_5uGZLxvzXkKxDwIdBa3K__eS-txTbKyeHxYmFl4814DZ0M9EkgLybUxSpw_iBXlwew" alt=""/></figure>



<p>Brick Lane in East London was my first stop, where I was hit with a beautiful range of colourful street art and graffiti which I just had to snap some photos of. The Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G effortlessly picked up all the vibrancy and light within the shot thanks to the trio of lenses and incredible LED flash. If posting art across your social media platforms is your thing, this is the perfect camera for you.&nbsp;</p>



<p>My second stop with the Sony Xperia by my side was the South African restaurant Shaka Zulu in Camden Market. Thanks to Optical Image Stabilisation, Night Mode and Auto HDR, my photos were blur-free, stable and clear despite the restaurant&#8217;s very low lighting conditions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All the beautiful colours of the dishes were picked up at exceptional quality, and again the incredible LED flash illuminated the shot efficiently. A photo so good you can almost taste it. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10537" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-150x113.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sony-Blog-1.jpg 1249w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h2><strong>Feature 3: Powerful 5,000mAh Battery For All Day Power&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>A long-lasting battery is essential for any long day out, I mean there’s music to be played, photos to be taken and videos to be streamed. Thankfully the Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G is equipt with a large capacity 5,000mAh battery giving users much-needed ‘all-day power’.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3: Battery Test </strong></h2>



<p>Leaving my house at 11 AM with the Sony handset by my side, and not getting back home until 11 PM that night, gave this handset a solid 12 hours test to see if the claim of ‘all-day power’ had some proof behind it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3: Result</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="447" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-1024x447.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10544" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-150x65.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-300x131.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-768x335.png 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-1024x447.png 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-1536x670.png 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/battery-xperia-2-2048x894.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Starting on a 100% charge and after 12 hours of photo-taking, bursts of gaming and music-playing, the Xperia device&#8217;s 5,000mAh battery only dropped by 12% &#8211; not bad at all for a full day&#8217;s work. Life with this smartphone means using a power bank won&#8217;t be a regular occurrence at all. Looks like the ‘All Day Power’ statement has proof in the pudding after all.</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 4: Premium Sound&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Sony and premium sound come hand in hand. For a truly authentic listening experience, the 10 IV 5G is equipt with High-Resolution Audio (which gives you premium sound), 360 Reality Audio Upmix (which works with local audio files and streaming services to further enhance your listening experience) and a 3.5mm audio jack (perfect for on the go streaming).&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 4:  Sound Test </strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-container-2 wp-block-gallery-1 wp-block-gallery has-nested-images columns-default is-cropped">
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="1024" data-id="10543"  src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10543" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-80x80.jpg 80w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3-768x768.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MicrosoftTeams-image-3.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>
</figure>



<p>As a music lover, I was excited to test out the audio quality on this device. The golden question was would the experience be mini-concert worthy and premium? To answer this burning question I headed to Spotify, pressed a feel-good song and listened away.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 4: Result</strong></h2>



<p>The audio quality from this handset was one of a kind. The 360 Reality Upmix feature in particular created an immersive experience in real-time. Achieving premium quality sound on this device is done with ease.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ultimately I found the 10 IV 5G very impressive. Not only were the acclaimed stand-out features regarding the display, camera, sound and battery true, but they actually exceeded my expectations. </p>



<p>After hearing all the wonderful things the<a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/sony-xperia-10-iv-5g-128gb-black"> Sony Xperia 10 IV 5G</a> has to offer I&#8217;m sure you’re eager to get your hands on a device of your own.

<p>If you’re a proud owner of the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g">Samsung Galaxy S21</a> you’re probably always on the lookout for cool tips and tricks to do with your <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals">handset.</a> Well, your search stops here, Fonehouse is here to give you 5 of the best tips, tricks and hidden features you’ve got to try on your S21 device.</p>



<h2>Tip 1: How To Switch On Quick Launch Camera Button<strong> </strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="660" height="660" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/samsung-galaxy-s21-CAMERA-1.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10447" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/samsung-galaxy-s21-CAMERA-1-80x80.jpg 80w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/samsung-galaxy-s21-CAMERA-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/samsung-galaxy-s21-CAMERA-1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/samsung-galaxy-s21-CAMERA-1.jpg 660w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" /></figure>



<p>We’ve probably all been through the heartbreaking moment where you’ve seen something funny, you try to open your camera app to capture it but you were simply too slow so you miss the whole thing. Well with the Samsung Galaxy S21 you can defeat this problem by enabling your handset to automatically launch the camera app with just two presses of the power button. To do this head to: <strong>Settings &gt; Advanced Features &gt;Side Key&gt; Enable quick Launch Camera</strong> Option <strong>(sidenote: make sure the Double Press toggle is switched on). </strong>The days of fumbling around trying to launch your camera are over.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Tip 2: How To Adjust Screen Tint </h2>

With each option you select a slider will appear at the bottom allowing you to adjust exactly how warm or cool you want your display to be. If this isn&#8217;t slider isn&#8217;t enough detail for you don&#8217;t worry, all you have to do is press the <strong>Advanced Settings </strong>button at the bottom of the screen, and RGB sliders will appear allowing you to fine-tune your display even more.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Tip 3: How To Turn On Video Enhancer </h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="477" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/samsung-galaxy-s21-devices-1-1024x477.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10445" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/samsung-galaxy-s21-devices-1-150x70.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/samsung-galaxy-s21-devices-1-300x140.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/samsung-galaxy-s21-devices-1-768x358.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/samsung-galaxy-s21-devices-1-1024x477.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/samsung-galaxy-s21-devices-1.jpg 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you’re a loyal <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">iPhone</a> user you’ll know the exciting feeling of unboxing a brand new iPhone very well. I mean it feels pretty great, an unmarked flawless screen, sleek body and a camera roll nice and empty ready for you to fill up. But there&#8217;s always one main question that hits you shortly after, ‘do I invest in AppleCare+ or reliable mobile phone protection accessories instead?’. Well, Fonehouse is here to answer your dilemma so your pondering ends here.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>AppleCare+</strong></h2>



<p>When it comes to precious technology, some of us are more accident-prone than others. So when AppleCare+ first hit the scene in 2011 there was a fair amount of buzz around it. If you’ve been living under a rock and you don&#8217;t know what AppleCare+ is, it is Apple&#8217;s own extended warranty and technical support plan for their devices. </p>



<h2><strong>What Does AppleCover Cover?</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="395" height="464" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/apple-care-plus-phone.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10437" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/apple-care-plus-phone-128x150.jpg 128w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/apple-care-plus-phone-255x300.jpg 255w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/apple-care-plus-phone.jpg 395w" sizes="(max-width: 395px) 100vw, 395px" /></figure>



<p>Standard AppleCare+ for iPhones includes a warranty cover of up to two incidents of accidental damage every 12 months. With this cover, you’ll receive discounted repair fees compared to what you would pay without an extended warranty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The AppleCare+ With Theft and Loss version of this extended warranty plan does what it says on the tin, and offers everything standard Apple Care+ does but with theft and loss scenarios included.</p>



<h2><strong>Is AppleCare Worth it?</strong></h2>



<p>After reading all that AppleCare+ has to offer above it might seem like a bargain, however in the long run this can be quite expensive as the cost varies depending on which iPhone model you have. Here’s a quick rundown on the approximate prices:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-table"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>iPhone Model</strong></td><td><strong>AppleCare+</strong></td><td><strong>AppleCare+ with Theft &amp; Loss</strong></td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 13 (128GB)</td><td>£139/yr</td><td>£189/yr</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 13 Pro (128GB)</td><td>£189/yr</td><td>£239/yr</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 12 (64GB)</td><td>£139/yr</td><td>£189/yr</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone 11 (64GB)</td><td>£139/yr</td><td>£189/yr</td></tr><tr><td>iPhone SE (64GB)</td><td>£69/yr</td><td>£119/yr</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>If you still want to protect your phone without having to fork out a lot of money on AppleCare+ protection don&#8217;t worry, high-quality <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories">mobile accessories</a> are a great option instead, and Fonehouse has a bunch of them. </p>



<h2><strong>Screen Protectors</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="500" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-13-screen-protector.png" alt="" class="wp-image-10435" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-13-screen-protector-80x80.png 80w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-13-screen-protector-150x150.png 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-13-screen-protector-300x300.png 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/iphone-13-screen-protector.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></figure>



<p>A top-quality <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-accessories/screen-protector">screen protector</a> is a barrier between your handset and the world. With this piece of mobile accessory gear on even during the clumsiest moments, your screen should remain intact.

<p>When <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/honor-mobile-phone-deals">HONOR</a> create handsets they go big. Whether that’s a premium sophisticated design, advanced camera system, first-class display or maybe all of those features combined -well at least that&#8217;s the case for the HONOR Magic4 Pro. This flagship handset has been a highly anticipated one, and we at <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/">Fonehouse</a> were lucky enough to get our hands on one early. We’ve selected three stand-out features of the handset, put them to the test, recorded the result and even added a top tip in there as a bonus. Your decision on whether to take the plunge and get this new HONOR handset made easy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1: First-Time Combination First-Class Display</strong></h2>



<p>There’s a lot of hype surrounding the HONOR Magic4 Pro 6.81” 120Hz adaptive LTPO OLED display. Some phrases that have been thrown out there to describe it are: “truly immersive” “exclusive” and “first-class”. On paper this display seems pretty cool, I mean it&#8217;s quad-curved designed, has a DCI-P3 wide colour gamut and is IMAX ENHANCED certified. Hmm seems pretty impressive right?</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1 Test: </strong></h2>



<p>What’s the one thing we pretty much all do on our devices? Stream entertainment content of course! I headed to the likes of Youtube and Netflix to see if the HONOR Magic4 Pro display really brings visuals to life or not.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1 Result:</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10403" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.56-PM.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>My first stop was Youtube to check out the trailer for the new Avatar: The Way of Water film due to be released later this year. The first thing I noticed was how beautifully in-depth the colours were on the screen. The deepest blues, browns and greens were featured paired with an impressive crystal clear quality. From this test, it’s obvious that the DCI-P3 wide colour gamut and IMAX enhanced certification features are paying off. This experience was like a mini-cinema in the palm of my hand. The “truly immersive” statement is true after all.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 1 Tip:</strong></h2>



<p>With a screen as flawless as this, you need to make the most of all things entertainment. So my top tip would be to watch a big blockbuster on the handset! The quad-curved design in particular really does elevate the typical viewing experience so you’ll be in for a treat.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2: Ultra Fusion Photography</strong></h2>



<p>The advanced camera system behind the HONOR Magic4 Pro has been noted to be one of the handset&#8217;s top stand-out features. With this triple-lens setup (consisting of a 50MP wide lens, a 50MP ultra-wide lens and a 64MP Periscope Telephoto lens), users can effortlessly capture what they see, enjoy HDR photography due to a superior lens, and even enjoy a spectacular night mode.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2 Test:</strong></h2>



<p>I was curious to see if the HONOR Magic4 Pro camera was all it was made up to be, so I did the logical thing and explored the great outside with it (and by outside I mean I went for a fancy breakfast and snapped some pics of my food). Were the photos remarkably perfect and most importantly Instagram worthy? Well, keep scrolling to find out.</p>

<p>I was impressed with the HONOR Magic4 Pro’s photography power. Not only were all the beautiful fine details picked up thanks to the ‘Advanced 7P Wide Camera’, but my shots were completely stable every time thanks to the handsets Flicker Sensor.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="768" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1024x768.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10394" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-150x113.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-300x225.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-400x300.jpg 400w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-768x576.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-800x600.jpg 800w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1200x900.jpg 1200w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/IMG_20220521_141954-5-2048x1536.jpg 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Aside from snapping photos of food as you can see from above, I did capture some photos of sceneries too. Again this HONOR device pulled through with its HDR photography and 122° field of view on the Ultra Wide Angle lens, to give me incredible high-quality photos. In my book, this camera is definitely Instagram approved.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 2 Tip:&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>In regards to this feature, my top tip is to actually get up and leave your house for once! The HONOR Magic4 Pro camera is simply too good to be sitting inside all day. Get up, explore and take wonderful photos along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3 GPU Turbo X: </strong></h2>



<p>Let&#8217;s start off with the basics, what actually is GPU Turbo X? GPU Turbo X uses AI rendering which enables your smartphone to keep high-quality visuals on-screen whilst lowering energy consumption at the same time. Included frame rate boosting technology paired with this consumption adjustment factor also enhances battery life and ultimately aims to improve the overall gaming experience. It’s time to put this cool feature to the test.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3 Test:</strong></h2>



<p>Okay so the method I took for this test is pretty obvious, I headed to the Google Play Store and downloaded a game -big shock I know. The particular game, I trialed out was ‘Race Master 3D- Car Racing’ for the lengthy duration of two hours.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3 Result:</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignfull size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="682" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-1024x682.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10404" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-150x100.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-768x512.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/WhatsApp-Image-2022-05-25-at-2.15.57-PM.jpg 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>The effects of the GPU Turbo X feature were clearly evident to me. Despite gaming for a solid two hours straight the battery life on the HONOR Magic4 Pro remained consistently high, and the graphics were continually top-quality. Compared to gaming on other handsets, I found gaming on this device more hands-on, and the experience as a whole was more immersive and addictive (hence gaming for two hours straight). So if you’re a gaming fanatic out there you’re in luck, this HONOR handset is bound to elevate your experience to levels you’ve never reached before.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Feature 3 Tip:</strong></h2>



<p>Maybe you’re an avid gamer and you already know all the hit games, but if you’re not I suggest you do some research on what’s popular right now in the world of Andriod gaming. Find a pick and try it out for yourself on the HONOR Magic4 Pro. See for yourself if it&#8217;s worth all the hype (big spoiler: it most definitely is).&nbsp;</p>





<p>After reading all the ins and outs regarding the features the HONOR Magic4 Pro has to offer from its beautiful large display to its remarkable photography power, I&#8217;m sure you’ll want to find the best money-saving deal too right? Well look no further Fonehouse has a bunch of <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/honor-magic4-pro-5g">fantastic deals</a> on this handset up for grabs.&nbsp;</p>

</figure>



<p>The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/xiaomi-12-5g">Xiaomi 12 5G</a> was another highly anticipated handset that dropped from Xiaomi’s 12 series range in April 2022.

<p>Xiaomi’s Redmi devices take a more affordable approach when it comes to smartphones, and are great for those seeking a budget-friendly but high-quality device. In early 2022, two Redmi handsets were launched one being the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/xiaomi-redmi-note-11-pro-5g">Xiaomi Redmi Note 11 Pro 5G</a>.

<p>Myths and rumours exist around pretty much every topic, mobile phone-based myths being one of the most famous types. When it comes to precious technology you can’t believe everything you hear, and the famous ideas that you might have believed were facts for the last decade might be in fact untrue. Fonehouse is here to debunk a selection of famous mobile myths &#8211; if you’re interested keep scrolling.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>1. Putting Your Phone In Rice </strong></h2>



<p>Putting your mobile phone into rice has been a famous solution to a water damaged phone that&#8217;s been around for decades. You’ve probably done this hack yourself out of desperation or known someone who’s attempted it. However, this phone sparing method is simply just a myth and is the same as just letting your phone dry out on a counter. As soon as liquid hits a non-water resistant device, corrosion is instant. Sometimes we get lucky enough that the liquid doesn’t hit vital internal parts of our device, and sometimes the damage is detrimental. Extensive research has shown that if a person has in fact found their device to be fully functioning after leaving it in rice, it’s most likely because it’s just had the chance to fully dry out. So no matter if you just leave your device on the side, or buried deep in rice the result will be the same. No rice needed.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>2. Keeping Your Bank Card Next To Your Phone Causes Damage&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1440" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10300" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/markus-winkler-ahjzVINkuCs-unsplash-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>There’s been an ongoing rumour that keeping your bank card and your mobile phone in the same pocket can demagnetize your card, ultimately making it useable, but this in fact is simply untrue. Although all smartphones have a magnetic field, this field is nowhere near strong enough to affect your bank cards. Instead, the prolonged exposure to magnetic fields you should watch out for is on things like fridge magnets and wallet clasps.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>3. Closing Background Running Apps Speeds Up Your Phone and Saves Battery&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<figure class="wp-block-image alignwide size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1441" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-scaled.jpg" alt="" class="wp-image-10301" srcset="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/brett-jordan-T40IzBBB9YY-unsplash-1-edited-scaled.jpg 2560w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" /></figure>



<p>You might think that having multiple apps open on your phone can slow it down, however, the majority of modern-day smartphones are tactically built to be able to handle and proficiently optimise running apps whilst others are waiting in the background. Apps open in the background do not use up processing power, RAM or memory because they’re not actively running. This ultimately spares your battery and keeps your device speedy.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>4. The More Megapixels The Better The Camera&nbsp;</strong></h2>
