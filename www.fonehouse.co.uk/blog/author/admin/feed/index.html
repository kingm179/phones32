<p>When it comes to getting great deals on products just in time for Christmas, then <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/black-friday-phone-deals\">Black Friday</a> is a great time to start, especially with our Vodafone Black Friday deals. This year November 26th is the date to mark on your calendars as we take a look at some of the best deals you will see on Vodafone handsets.</p>
<h2><strong>Do Your Research</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to getting the best deal, you want to start your research sooner rather than later. There is a huge range of different handsets on the market. With the growth of the Vodafone 5G network then this is only going to increase the number of new devices hitting the market. So, you want to make sure you know exactly what phone it is that you are going to be aiming for.</p>
<h2><strong>To 5G or Not to 5G?</strong></h2>
<p>5G has grown massively in the last year. It hasn&#8217;t reached everywhere yet, but it will do.&nbsp; Given that all networks have been upgraded to 5G, you might decide that now is the right time to upgrade to 5G.</p>
<h2><strong>Handsets to Watch For</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to picking your handset there are some fantastic models out there to choose from that are all likely to see deals on Black Friday. The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/basket/add/contract/iphone-13-5g-128gb-midnight/vodafone-47pm-25gb-red-plan-band-5-new/free-delivery?source=sale3">iPhone 13</a> is a stunning piece of kit from Apple and their best phone on the market currently. If you are an Apple fan, then this is the mobile you should go to. Apple doesn&#8217;t often offer discounts on their kit, but Black Friday is normally an exception. Vodafone are known for their market leading Black Friday phone deals so you\&#8217;re going to want to keep an eye out for this one.</p>
<h2><strong>Other Rising Stars</strong></h2>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong>The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/basket/add/contract/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-3-5g-128gb-cream/vodafone-50pm-unlimited-unlimited-band-6-new/free-delivery?source=sale3">Samsung Galaxy Z Flip </a>line is another flagship phone to hit 2021 and what&#8217;s not to love about the new <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/basket/add/contract/google-pixel-6-5g-128gb-stormy-black/vodafone-33pm-150gb-red-plan-band-9-new-100gb-8mrcd/free-delivery?source=sale3">Google Pixel 6 5G</a> device.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Year-Round Deals</strong></h2>
<p>When it comes to finding the best deals on <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/network/vodafone-mobile-phone-deals">Vodafone mobiles</a>, then we always aim to deliver, not just on Black Friday.

<p>There are so many different FaceTime features you will love from the latest iOS update. They make video calling so much more fun! Once you’ve learnt all about its very best features, we’re sure you’ll want to jump on FaceTime calls right away. It definitely makes this online social life a lot more fun.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is FaceTime?</h2>
<p>FaceTime is something that has been on Apple devices since the very beginning. It’s gone through a number of different face lifts and changes to get it to where it is now. FaceTime is the Apple default app, which you can use to video call other Apple devices.There’s are so many FaceTime features you will love that you’re going to want to pay attention to as well!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What devices can use it?</h2>
<p>FaceTime is actually available on all iOS devices, even Apple watches! Depending on how old your device is depends on whether or not you’ll be able to use all the features. The best FaceTime variants come from iOS 12. This means that if you’ve got anything later than an iPhone 6, you may not be able to enjoy all the best features.</p>
<p>A few middle eastern countries don’t allow FaceTime on their Apple devices. This is because a lot of countries calls are tapped and traced to avoid terrorism threats. With the Apple encryption policies, they cannot tap into any FaceTime calls, therefore banning this feature. FaceTime is not available in the United Arab Emirates for these reasons however, it is enabled in Saudi Arabia and Pakistan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Group Video Calls</h2>
<p>A huge perk of FaceTime is that you can have up to 32 people on one call. This is perfect to catch up with everyone at once. The group call feature comes from iOS 12. This means that the majority of iPhones will have access to this feature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to add multiple people to your FaceTime call, you can click ‘Add People’ to dial in other contacts. You do have to already be on a FaceTime call in order to get this button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another way you can start group calls is from group iMessages. When you click into an iMessage group chat, you’ll be able to call other contacts by clicking the information button at the top. Here you’ll be able to enter a group call, which calls the entire group at one time. When the call is active, users can join and leave whilst without dialling in.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Effects and Stickers</h2>
<p>The latest iOS update gives FaceTime users loads of new effects and stickers to enjoy. Using the effects, you can turn yourself into a Memoji or Animoji. The infrared sensors in the iPhone tracks your facial movement, making the Animoji or Memoji move with you. This includes mouth movement, eye movement, even micro expressions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also add all Apple emojis as stickers to the screen. When you place the stickers, they’ll pin to the area you put them. This means stickers remain where you have put them, even when you move.</p>
<p>You also have the option to add text to the screen too. You can edit this to say exactly what you want it to. There are a number of different fonts available from classic fonts to super exciting one.</p>
<p>You will only be able to use these features on devices with Face ID. This is because infrared is used to track your face to meet the movements. Only devices with Face ID have inferred sensors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Complete Privacy&nbsp;</h2>
<p>A huge perk of using FaceTime over any other video cal app is that is has end-to-end encryption. Privacy is something that’s incredibly important to Apple. This means that all of your calls and messages are completely private, even Apple can’t listen to your calls or view your messages. FaceTime calls are never recorded or intercepted by anyone. The only think Apple keeps track of is who called who for up to 30 days.&nbsp; They don’t even keep track of the duration of calls or whether&nbsp; call was answered or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’re giving you all the best tips on how to set up a new iPhone so that you can get started quicker than ever before when you receive your phone. From quick tips to longer walk throughs, we’re going to give you everything you need to know. You’ll be set up in no time!</p>
<h2>How to set up a new iPhone</h2>
<p>The first step you’ll have to do once you’ve turned on your mobile phone is select your language. This will make sure that the date and time is correct, and even how the home screen looks. After this, you’ll be asked to connect to your wifi. This is crucial in setting up your phone however, you can use your mobile data if easier. Once you’ve connected to an internet connection, the phone will update to make sure it’s working to its full potential.</p>
<p>Most iPhone’s that are currently available will allow you to set up Face ID or Touch ID. These both offer you super secure access to your mobile phone. You do have the option to set up just a passcode or even no security. We would highly advise that you do set up some sort of security on your mobile phone just to ensure your data stays safe.</p>
<p>From here, you can restore information through a number of different avenues. This includes the ability to restore data from an Android device. You can also choose to set the mobile phone up as an entirely new device if this is what you would like. You’ll then be asked to sign in to your Apple ID and approve a number of different features, such as Siri and automatic updates. Once you’ve accepted or declined these, you’ll be all set to go.</p>
<h2>How to turn an iPhone on</h2>
<p>Of course, turning on an iPhone is one of the first steps to knowing how to set up a new iPhone. It’s actually super easy to turn on a mobile phone. All you need to do is press and hold the power button. This is usually found on the side of the phone but can be found at the top on older devices. You need to hold this down until the Apple logo appears on the screen. You will also notice that the phone vibrates. At this point, you can let go of the button and the phone will turn on in a few seconds.</p>
<h2>Using Quick Start</h2>
<p>Quick Start is an Apple feature that means setting up your new feature so much easier than before. You’ll only be able to use Quick Start if you already have an old iPhone. With this, all you need to do is grab your current iPhone and unlock it. Place this close to your new iPhone and just wait for your new phone to connect. You’ll now get a few instructions on the screen. This just lets you know that the phone is syncing and will set up shortly.</p>
<p>You’re going to want to get your hands on a new phone now that you know exactly how to set up a new iPhone. <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">View our iPhone deals</a> to save money and find the perfect package. We’ll even offer free next day delivery do you can enjoy it quickly!</p>

<p>Every single year, we see a huge event take place in the mobile phone industry so here’s what to expect from MWC 2021. With COVID restrictions still in place, it’s not going to be quite the same as usual. In 2020, they actually cancelled the event!</p>
<h2>What is MWC?</h2>
<p>So, what is MWC? MWC stands for Mobile World Congress. This is an event that takes place every single year and it’s where we see a lot of the best, most exciting handsets and other tech due to be released for the year. This is the biggest mobile event of the year. In 2020, the event was cancelled due to COVID however, it’s still going ahead in 2021. The cancellation previously saw a few exciting manufacturer events, such as the Sony release, taking place online. This is where we got all our information for releases due to come in 2020.</p>
<h2>When does it take place?</h2>
<p>Usually, MWC takes place in March. This year, we’ve seen it delayed to June 28th, lasting until July 1st. This event has been pushed back with hopes to keep its plans in place.&nbsp; Event organisers are hoping that different members of the tech community will be able to attend with the ease of restrictions expected. If it goes ahead, MWC 2021 will be held in Barcelona with a number of different online features. This is where the event is held each year.</p>
<h2>What can we expect from Sony?</h2>
<p>Usually, Sony takes this exciting event and announces the release of their flagship devices for the rest of the year. 2019 saw them announce the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/sony-xperia-1\">Sony Xperia 1</a>. Just last year, they announced the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/sony-xperia-1-ii\">Xperia 1 II</a> through their own online event. Could this potentially mean we’ll be getting a mark three in 2021? So far, Sony haven’t released any hints or confirmed any details as to what we can expect from them in 2021. We can work out that it’s highly likely we’ll see them announce a release for the third or fourth quarter of the year at the event.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Huawei?</h2>
<p>Huawei usually save their flagship devices for their own release event. That doesn’t mean that they don’t bring anything exciting to the table at the MWC events though! We usually see a new Huawei tech product, whether it’s a laptop or headphones. We would expect for Huawei to continue this streak and announce another tech product to add to the list, perhaps a new smartwatch. It’s also likely that they’re announce a few predecessor handsets at the event. We could see an improved foldable device or even just a new Mate addition.</p>
<h2>More Manufacturers&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Nokia is one mobile phone manufacturer that seems to save a lot of their products for the event. In fact, they have one of the biggest presences at MWC. This could also be down to the fact that they offer a huge range of affordable and higher end devices. We would hope to see a new Nokia flagship device released at MWC 2021. It’s also highly likely that we’ll get a few lower specification devices too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another big name at the event will be LG. Like a number of other brands, they save their flagship announcements for MWC. With that in mind, we’re expecting to see the next flagship LG announcement at the end of July. This is bound to offer a much more affordable device to the market whilst keeping specifications relatively high too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now you know what to expect from MWC 2021, you’ll want to make sure you tune in. Don’t think you can wait much longer for a new mobile phone? <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/\">View our deals</a> to save money on the latest tech.</p>

<p>Refurbished phones are the way forward! You’ll be able to save money on your everyday bills whilst enjoying modern technology. Our growing range will allow you to choose the mobile phones you love. We’ll even make sure it’s in great condition so you love it for years to come.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is a refurbished phone?</h2>
<p>Essentially, a refurbished phone is a device that has been previously owned and sold on after use. We like to ensure that all refurbished phones we sell on are grade A condition. Even if in pristine condition, we aren’t able to sell these devices as brand new as they have already been opened and used. All in all, the only difference really is the price.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Refurbished mobile phones don’t come with headphones. This is for hygiene reasons. We cannot guarantee that these haven’t been used before so they are removed before the phones are screened. There is no guarantee that you will receive any original accessories. This includes both a charging plug and the charging wire itself.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With the release of the new Samsung flagship, we’ve got some of the best Samsung Galaxy S21 5G deals available RIGHT NOW! From low prices to high data packages, there really is something for everyone. Working with the top networks in the UK means we can bring you the very best mobile phone contracts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>About the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G</h2>
<p>You may notice just how smooth the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G screen really is. This is down to the 120Hz refresh rate. Over the last year or so, we’ve seen a number of new features hitting the market. One that was introduced last year with the highest specification device. This year, Samsung have introduced the 120Hz refresh rate to all of their variants. This not only makes the images and text smoother on the screen, but it also allows for a far more responsive screen too. When you swipe between screens or even open up an app, it will happen so much faster than predecessors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something that users get excited about every single year is the camera. On the Samsung Galaxy S21 5G, you can find a triple lens camera. In this is a 12MP wide lens, a 64MP telephoto lens and a 12MP ultra wide lens. Each of these additions will allow you to capture photos from different angles and in different styles. You’ll also be able to enjoy high resolution, detailed images from each addition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>EE Prices&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Every single customer that joins the EE network will also have access to EE entertainment. Through this, you can enjoy a number of different 3-6 month free trial subscriptions. In this plan, you can enjoy names such as Apple Music and BT Sports. It’s an amazing addition to a mobile phone contract, giving users the ability to discover new brands and save money. Once the trial periods have come to an end, you will be able to either continue at a monthly cost or cancel the subscriptions. The best thing about this perk is that you can enjoy every single trial subscription available.</p>
<p>Whilst EE have plenty of benefits that add huge value to a mobile phone contract, they have also won a huge amount of awards. In fact, for 7 years running, EE have been voted the UKs No 1 network. This goes to show that EE can offer high quality experiences whilst keeping this up. They even provide the fastest network speeds and the best network coverage in the UK. All customers on EE will be able to enjoy this amazing perk of the network.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Three Deals</h2>
<p>There are two different perks you can enjoy when joining Three. One that all users can make use of is Go Roam. Using this, you’ll be able to travel to a range of destinations in the EU, Australia and the USA without incurring nasty roaming charges. Instead, you can use your monthly allowance for free. If you join Three with over 12GB of data in your contract, you can enjoy their Go Binge perk. With this, you can use certain apps, such as Snapchat and SoundCloud, without eating away at your data. All you need is a small amount of data to get started and you’ll be good to go.</p>
<p>Three are known for their huge data packages and this is something they’re keeping up with our Samsung Galaxy S21 Plus 5G deals. By giving customers access to larger data packages for lower monthly costs, we can help you save money. There’s no need to pay for data bolt ons each month or experience the nasty costs of going over your monthly limit. Instead, enjoy a high data plan and make sure these are experiences you don’t come across.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Vodafone Packages</h2>
<p>A huge perk of joining the Vodafone network is their VeryMe Rewards. This is a small section of the Vodafone app that gives its users access to hundreds of different discounts. You can find discount codes giving you money off huge brands that you already love or even find a few new companies you may have never used before. Every now and then, you can even find codes to get free items, such as coffee or even small products. This is something that adds huge amounts of value to each Vodafone contract.</p>
<p>When you join Vodafone with a Red Entertainment plan, you’ll get the chance to enjoy a 24 month free subscription. This is only offered if you are on a Red Entertainment plan and can really build the value of your contract. These customers will be able to activate contracts with brands such as Spotify or Sky Sports. Once the 24 month contract comes to an end, they will be given the chance to either cancel or continue the subscription at a monthly cost.</p>
