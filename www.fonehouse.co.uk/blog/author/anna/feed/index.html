										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we approach Autumn, we all know the weather is about to change. Whilst we have seen some September sun, the colder days are approaching and what better way to make sure you’re ready than to have the best ranked weather apps at your fingertips. At Fonehouse we know how important it is to be prepared for whatever the weather might throw at you, so we’ve gathered lots of data to collate a list of the top 10 weather apps.</p>
<p>We all know that App store ratings are not always the best judge of an app – after all, it depends on a number of other factors such as the number of reviews, app features and whether or not you get inundated with ads.</p>
<p>Therefore, to come up with our list we’ve collected <a href="https://play.google.com/store?gl=GB">Google Play</a> ratings and reviews, <a href="https://www.apple.com/uk/app-store/">Apple store</a> ratings and reviews, as well as individual app data on weather warnings, day views and ads. We then averaged this across both stores and gave each app a score out of 12 per metric. By calculating the total score, we have been able to rank the weather apps – and give you our Top 10.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="aligncenter" src="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/best-weather-apps.jpg" alt="\&quot;infographic" width="\&quot;854\&quot;" height="\&quot;1133\&quot;" /></p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2><strong>Yahoo! Weather</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Not only is the Yahoo! Weather app visually pleasing, but it also hits our list at number 1. On the app you can see accurate hourly, 5-day and 10-day forecasts so you can plan in advance, and you will be notified if there is a weather warning. You don’t have to worry about ads as this app is completely ad free.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<h2><strong>Met Office </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>It will come as no surprise that the Met Office app comes in at second place. The experts sure know how to create a helpful and accurate weather app. The only thing that lets this app down and stopped it from taking the number 1 spot is the lack of forward forecasts – you can only view weather 7 days in advance.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<h2><strong>Weather &amp; Radar</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>With this app you can get accurate forecasts among other additions. You can see for 11 days in advance and the app gets a pretty good score across both app stores. The only downfall is that you do have to pay for the premium version – or you put up with the ads on the free version.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>
<h2><strong>AccuWeather</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This weather app is certainly popular – with over 1 million average reviews across app stores. It also offers forecasts for further ahead than any other app, showing a full 45-day forecast. It is however not ad free which is a big downfall for this app.</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<h2><strong>The Weather Channel </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Weather Channel app gets good ratings across stores, offers an impressive 14 day forecast and is great for adverse weather conditions as it sends accurate weather warnings as notifications. Unfortunately, as with a few others, this app is not ad free – but if you can look past that it is a great choice.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>
<h2>Windy.com</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Windy.com app offers some pretty impressive visuals – with a great map animation and layers so you can see different weather forecasts. However, it doesn’t have a large number of reviews just yet and unfortunately doesn’t send weather warnings.</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>
<h2><strong>BBC Weather</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The BBC Weather app may be lower down our list than you would expect, however unfortunately it doesn’t receive a particularly high rating across app stores with an average of 4.5. This may be down to the fact it doesn’t send weather warnings – however it does have a pretty impressive 14 day forecast and is easy to use.</p>
<ol start="8">
<li>
<h2><strong>Yr</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The Yr weather app offers a 10-day forecast, but unfortunately doesn’t get the best reviews across the app stores. This app is ad free, so worth a try for yourself if you are curious.</p>
<ol start="9">
<li>
<h2><strong>Weather Liveº</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This app offers an 8-day forecast, with weather warnings. However, the lower score resulted from a low number of reviews across app stores, and it is unfortunately not ad free. However, there is a premium version which may be worth a try.</p>
<ol start="10">
<li>
<h2><strong>Hello Weather</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Hello Weather takes the final spot on our list. Coming in at number 10, this weather app is fairly new – with an average of 452 reviews across app stores. With this app, you’ll get an 8 day forecast, no ads and a great design.</p>
<p>We hope this list is helpful when planning your outings for the future whether you’re an Apple or Android user. And, if you’re looking for a new phone this autumn, check out our <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/brand/apple-mobile-phone-deals">latest deals</a>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Following the release of the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-5g\"><span data-contrast="\&quot;none\&quot;">iPhone 13</span></a><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">, we’re starting to see an influx of people switching their phones. The iPhone 13 release saw a range of new colours – a total of nine across the&nbsp;product set, with 5 options in the iPhone 13 and 13 Mini range and 4 in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-13-pro-5g\"><span data-contrast="\&quot;none\&quot;">iPhone&nbsp;13&nbsp;Pro</span></a><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">&nbsp;and Pro Max range. So much colour choice really allows people to choose an iPhone that reflects their style – and offers plenty of options.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">So, what does your choice of iPhone colour say about you? We spoke to colour specialist Matthew Reacher to find out.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Mini</span></b></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Black/Midnight </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Black is the original iPhone colour, but this time we see a hint of navy blue added – to curate the colour ‘Midnight’. Matthew says that “choosing a black phone can suggest several things and introverts and extroverts alike might choose a black phone for different reasons.” For introverts, a black phone could be seen as a “non-attention seeking choice”. However, for extroverts it could symbolise “status and power, perhaps professionalism”. For many, black can simply be an aesthetic choice, according to Matthew.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Red</span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Red is most definitely a statement choice. Matthew states that a red phone choice is likely made by someone who is a “socially confident extrovert that often craves being the centre of attention”.&nbsp;It is possible that those who chose a red phone like to be unique and stand out from the crowd. He states that “personal uniqueness is very important to them”.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Blue </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">This time around, the blue model is lighter. In previous versions the blue was darker – with a navy hue. This time we see a lighter version, with hints of turquoise. Matthew believes a blue iPhone is likely chosen if it is a person’s favourite colour “probably due to its relaxing influences”. Those who choose a blue iPhone likely “crave the tranquillity of the ocean”. Additionally, it can suggest a desire for self-expression and creativity.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Pink </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">This time around we see the first baby pink iPhone. Matthew believes that because of pinks association with femininity, the pink phone is likely to be chosen by someone “very in-tune with&nbsp;their femininity”. Likely this person is very “compassionate, affectionate and nurturing”&nbsp;– with a very extroverted personality and social presence.</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">White/Starlight</span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">This white iPhone has a pearly, iridescent hue. Matthew states that there can be different reasons why a person might choose a white phone, the first being that they are an extrovert who enjoys being noticed. However, the second is that it may be the choice of someone who enjoys simplicity and have a strong need for cleanliness and symmetry.</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Graphite </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">The grey or Graphite iPhone is very modern and sleek looking. According to Matthew this iPhone would be the choice of someone who values aesthetics and style but not in regard to impressing other people. “they are likely to be more inner-directed” focussing more on how they perceive themselves.</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Silver </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">With so many similar hues to grey, the silver iPhone has the same connotations as the Graphite version – again this phone is likely chosen by someone who values style and aesthetic but only in respect to themselves and their own opinions.</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Gold </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">A gold iPhone Pro is definitely a statement piece. Matthew states that “Gold is the colour of wealth”. Gold represents status and success and those who choose a gold phone may want to emulate that. Those who choose a gold iPhone are likely to be extroverted and&nbsp;care a “great deal about how others see them.”&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">Sierra Blue </span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h3>
<p><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">There is also a blue version of the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max, named Sierra Blue. Again, as blue is synonymous with the ocean and tranquillity it is likely that someone who chooses this colour is introverted and has a desire for calm and values creativity.&nbsp;</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><b><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">About the Expert&nbsp;</span></b><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://colorpsychologymeaning.com/\"><span data-contrast="\&quot;none\&quot;">Matthew Reacher is a colour&nbsp;expert</span></a><span data-contrast="\&quot;auto\&quot;">&nbsp;who studies colours and their meanings across various areas – including business and branding as well as spiritual significance. Colour psychology considers the various ways in which colour influences our minds and emotions as well as what our own personal colour choices say about our personalities.</span><span data-ccp-props="\&quot;{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\&quot;">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>With the new iPhone on the horizon, we thought it would be a great time to look back on the last 14 years of iPhone and see how far things have come. The first iPhone was introduced in 2007 – it was actually announced 6 months before it even went on sale in the US, which is very different to how the phone is launched now. So, let’s take a look at how the iPhone has developed over the years.</p>
<h2><strong>Apple iPhone</strong></h2>
<p>Released in 2007, in this first-generation iPhone, there was no selfie camera or ability to record video. It did have a standard headphone jack and a range of built-in apps such as safari and maps but it had no app store so you couldn’t download more apps.</p>

<h2><strong>Apple iPhone 3G </strong></h2>
<p>Just a little over a year later, the second iPhone was released – this time aptly named the iPhone 3G as it now included GPS and 3G data. This time the handset was a little thicker than it’s predecessor. This was also the first iPhone to also be available in white. This time, the phone did have the app store, so there was the option to download more apps but still no video recording.</p>

<p>The next year saw the release of the iPhone 5, which for the first time featured a larger screen than its predecessors. It was also the first iPhone to feature a selfie camera for other uses than video calling – and Apple have never looked back. This iPhone had major design changes, including the introduction of the smaller USB connector – the lightening cable and the Nano Sim. It was also the last model to be overseen by Steve Jobs.</p>

<h2><strong>Apple iPhone 5S </strong></h2>
<p>Released in 2013, and seen as an upgraded version of the iPhone, the 5S had some pretty interesting new additions. The iPhone 5S again featured the new design and larger screen and came with a storage capacity of up to 64GB. The iPhone 5S was the first iPhone to have fingerprint sensors and to utilise touch access. It also came in more than two colours – this time Apple offered a Space Gray as well as a White/Silver and a White/Gold version.</p>

The <a href="\&quot;https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-7\&quot;">iPhone 7</a> was the first iPhone to be waterproof. With the launch of the iPhone 7, Apple removed the standard headphone jack and instead changed their headphones to fit the lightening cable. It was also at this time that Apple began making ‘plus’ models of their phones for those who prefer a larger handset. So, alongside the iPhone 7 came the iPhone 7 Plus.</p>

<h2><strong>Apple iPhone 8 </strong></h2>
<p>In 2017, 10 years after the first iPhone was launched – Apple launched the <a href="\&quot;https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/apple-iphone-8\&quot;">iPhone 8</a>, the iPhone 8 plus and the iPhone X. The iPhone 8 was fairly similar in design to the iPhone 7 aside from a few upgrades such as power charging and wireless charging options. As with the iPhone 7, the 8 was also available in a larger size.</p>

<h2><strong>iPhone X </strong></h2>
<p>The iPhone 8 launch was somewhat overshadowed by one of Apple’s biggest releases to date – the iPhone X. Although announced at the same time, this release happened a couple of months later in November 2017. It was one of Apple’s biggest design chances that saw a massive increase in screen size as well as a vast range of improvements. At this point Apple got rid of the home button – instead replacing touch access with face recognition.</p>

<h2><strong>iPhone 12</strong></h2>
<p>The <a href="\&quot;../mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g\&quot;">iPhone 12</a> is 2020’s flagship phone for Apple. It features a fresh new design and is available in a wide range of colours. The upgrades from the iPhone 11 to the iPhone 12 mainly come from the addition of 5G and in the improved power capabilities. With the launch of the iPhone 12 we also saw the launch of the <a href="\&quot;../mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-pro-5g\&quot;">iPhone 12 Pro</a>, <a href="\&quot;../mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-pro-max-5g\&quot;">iPhone 12 Pro Max</a> and the <a href="\&quot;../mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-mini-5g\&quot;">iPhone 12 mini</a>.</p>

<p>Apple has confirmed they are hosting an event on September 14<sup>th</sup> at 6pm BST (10am PT/1pm ET).</p>
<p>It is widely expected, and <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/iphone-13-launch-date-confirmed-for-september-14-heres-all-we-know">reported by TechRadar</a> that this will be the launch of what is rumoured to be the iPhone 13. In true Apple style, the announcement of the September 14<sup>th</sup> event did not allude to any specific devices – but it is widely anticipated to include the new iPhone as well as potentially a new Apple watch and even a new iPad.</p>
<p>The event invite features an augmented reality component which lets users look through an Apple shaped portal and see a presumed Californian landscape.</p>
<h2><strong>Handset Rumours </strong></h2>
<p>It is has come to be expected that with any iPhone release, there will be a range of handset options. According to <a href="https://www.trustedreviews.com/news/iphone-13-release-date-specs-features-leaks-4106939\&quot;" data-wplink-edit="true">Trusted Reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/07/magsafe-charger-filing-new-iphones/">Mac Rumours</a>, this year will be no different. It is rumoured that once again there will be four handset variations. The names of the handsets are alleged to be: iPhone 13 Mini, iPhone 13, iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone 13 Pro Max.</p>
<h2><strong>Price and Pre-Order Rumours </strong></h2>
<p>Like everything Apple, the price of the rumoured new iPhone is completely under wraps. But sites, such as <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/deals/iphone-13-deals-how-much-is-apples-latest-device-likely-to-cost">TechRadar</a> who predict these things year on year have taken a stab at what the new phone could be priced at.</p>
<p>It is suggested that what could be called the iPhone 13 will be fairly similar in spec to the iPhone 12 therefore they expect it will have a similar price point. If previous launch events are anything to go by, it is anticipated that pre-orders for the device will begin just a few days after the event – so maybe the Thursday or Friday.</p>
<p>Going by previous launches, and the fact Apple has remained fairly consistent lately with price points – TechRadar suggests that the new iPhone could be priced around £799 – the same as the iPhone 12. If past releases are anything to go by, it is also rumoured there could be an iPhone 13 Mini, Pro and Pro Max. They are rumoured to cost, £699, £999 and £1099 respectively.</p>
<h2><strong>Design Rumours </strong></h2>
<p>Little change is expected in design from the iPhone 12. However, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-13-2021#section-iphone-13-design">TechRadar has reported</a> that there is a potential change in design to the rear camera. It is expected that the lenses will sit in a diagonal pattern. <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/234814/2021-iphone-13-rumors-specs-price-release.html">MacWorld does report</a> that the change in camera design could also see a slightly larger camera ‘bump’.</p>
<p>The other design change that has been highly suggested is a smaller notch, as a result of potentially smaller Face ID sensor. With the Pro and Pro Max, the situation is similar – not many design changes are expected. The only rumours really are surrounding colour options, and potentially less fingerprint prone stainless steel.</p>
<p>In terms of colour – we may see some new shades released with the iPhone 13 – <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-13-2021">TechRadar reports</a> we might see pink and orange and others similar to the 12 like purple. Similar reports have been made by <a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/234814/2021-iphone-13-rumors-specs-price-release.html">MacWorld</a> – with iPhone 12 colours all expected to remain.</p>
<h2><strong>Display Rumours </strong></h2>
<p>Again, screen sizes and resolution are not expected to differ much from the iPhone 12. However, <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-13-2021">TechRadar reports</a> that the Pro and Pro Max versions could see 120Hz refresh rates. Additionally, they expect to see an always-on display on each of the potential new handsets.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/234814/2021-iphone-13-rumors-specs-price-release.html">MacWorld reports</a> that this ‘always-on’ display could mean we constantly get to see the time, and battery life – perhaps even notifications.</p>
<h2><strong>Camera Rumours </strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-13-2021">TechRadar suggests</a> Apple is expected to tweak the camera on the new handset series. There are a range of rumours – from an upgraded ultra-wide shooter on the pro handsets as well as an upgraded telephoto camera. Video recording improvements are also expected, including a new portrait mode.</p>
<h2><strong>Spec Rumours</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-13-2021">According to TechRadar</a>, the handsets will be powered by the A15 chipset and there are even big rumours flying around that there could be a 1TB iPhone for the first time in 2021. The largest size of &nbsp;iPhone ever made.</p>
<h2><strong>Battery Rumours </strong></h2>
<p>There have been numerous rumours about the battery expected on the new iPhone. <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-13-2021">TechRadar</a> suspects that this will be much larger than previous versions – offering better battery life than any previous iPhones. Something Apple fans will be very happy to hear.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.macworld.com/article/356647/bigger-batteries-could-be-the-star-of-apples-september-event.html">MacWorld reported</a> that the mini handset could see an additional 1 hour of battery life, whilst the rumoured iPhone 13 and Pro could see an increase in battery capacity of 10%. The Pro Max is anticipated to see a huge 18-20% capacity increase.</p>
<h2><strong>Satellite Communication Rumours </strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/uk/news/iphone-13-release-date-price-specs-leaks">Tom’s Guide have reported</a> that the new iPhone is tipped to get satellite communication – which would be the first time for an iPhone. This feature would enable users to make calls or send messages without any 4G or 5G connection. This feature would be revolutionary for emergency calls – for example if you get stranded with no service.</p>

<p>The new <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/sony-xperia-1-III-5G">Sony Xperia 1 mark III</a> is being hailed as Sony’s best handset yet – and we would have to agree. The Xperia 1 III is Sony’s new flagship smartphone and offers one of the best displays, impeccable battery life and an impressive camera that is easy to use.</p>
<p>Sony revealed their new flagship phone back in April 2021 – but it is only now being released, so we have had a good 4 months to get ready for this exciting launch and we can’t wait for you to get your hands on it.</p>
<h2><strong>Design </strong></h2>
<p>The design of the latest Xperia 1 III model is not dissimilar to previous models in the range. It features the same long and narrow design as its predecessors – this time with a 6.5 inch 21:9 aspect ratio display. The design makes this handset much longer than its rival handsets such as the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s22-ultra-5g">Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra</a>.</p>
<p>This time around, the Sony handset is a little thicker than the Xperia 1 II – this is purely to make room for the large battery and don’t worry you won’t even notice the difference in size!</p>
<p>Something worth noting is that this phone features front-facing stereo speakers, the same as previous models, but in this case, they are 30% louder so if you are looking for a phone that does your music justice – this could be the one.</p>
<h2><strong>Display </strong></h2>
<p>Sony Xperia handsets are the only ones to feature 4K resolution so you can always be sure you’re getting a stunning display. This time, Sony have opted for a 120Hz refresh rate – so the Xperia 1 III is at the top of the game. Making playing games, watching videos and streaming content much easier.</p>

<h2><strong>Camera</strong></h2>
<p>It might not seem like much has been updated at first glace however there are some serious improvements to the camera on the Xperia 1 III. Not only does the 12MP 24mm main camera improve the image quality but the optical image stabilisation keeps pictures steady – great for anyone with a shaky hand. Not only that but the ultra-wide camera lets you take a range of shots – with a variable telephoto camera which can actually switch between focal lengths.</p>
<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>
<p>This device has a massive 256GB of storage so you can keep all of your perfectly shot images and videos as well as all your apps. Not only that, but one of the most impressive things about this new handset is the battery life. Compared to the Xperia 1 II there is a significant improvement in battery life – so even with all the great features of this phone it should last all day (and beyond).</p>
<h2><strong>Deals at Fonehouse</strong></h2>
<p>You all know by now, we love a good deal at Fonehouse. So, when you purchase a Sony Xperia 1 III from 19<sup>th</sup> August you will receive a free pair of Sony WH-1000XM3 headphones. All you need to do is purchase the handset or a qualifying contract and you will receive your headphones with your device.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Each year sees plenty of new releases, some more highly anticipated than others. 2021 is no different – this year we have already seen a breadth of fun and exciting new phones released onto the market. Including the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s21-5g\">Samsung Galaxy S21</a>, <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s21-plus-5g\">S21 Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/samsung-galaxy-s21-ultra-5g\">S21 Ultra</a>. And it is not stopping there – we are still expecting to see some more big releases from the likes of Samsung, Sony, Xiaomi, Nokia, and OnePlus just to name a few.</p>
<p>Of course, we can’t discuss the most anticipated phone releases of the year without mentioning Apple’s eagerly awaited announcement on the next iPhone – but aside from that we have some other rumoured releases that we think are quite exciting as well.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<h2>The New iPhone</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Each year, the Apple iPhone release tends to be the most highly anticipated – and this year is no different. As always, we’re all expecting this release in September and the rumour mill is already churning as to what we might expect from Apple this time around.</p>
<p>Whilst nothing is confirmed, it has been reported by sites such as <a href="https://www.techradar.com/uk/news/new-iphone-13-2021\">TechRadar</a>, that the new iPhone won’t differ too much in design from its predecessor – the iPhone 12. However, we’re sure there will be plenty of new, exciting upgrades to the current specification and we’re looking forward to finding out more. Like the ones before it, rumours say that there will be plenty of options when it comes to the variants of the handsets – such as the “mini” and “Pro” versions.</p>
<ol start=\"2\">
<li>
<h2>The New Samsung Galaxy Z Fold Range</h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>At Fonehouse, we can appreciate something a little bit weird but wonderful. And, that is exactly what we’re expecting from the New Samsung Galaxy Fold Handset. Following on from the release of the Z Fold 2 in 2020, this new release from Samsung is going to continue building on the relatively new success of the foldable phone.</p>
<p>Still in their early days, foldable phones have a way to go – so over the next few years we would expect improvements in things such as durability, size, and weight to ensure these phones get lighter and thinner as they develop.</p>
<ol start=\"3\">
<li>
<h2><strong>Huawei P50 </strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Always the innovators, Huawei’s latest release is expected to top their last in terms of design and specification. Things that are rumoured to be improved in Huawei P50 are the camera and hardware. We’re expecting big things from the camera in this phone – with Huawei consistently topping the market when it comes to camera quality.</p>
<p>The only downfall might be the software – Huawei currently do not have access to Google apps or the Google Play Store, which can hamper the experience in terms of software. However, more than likely Huawei developed Apps will run through “Huawei Petal Search” from Launch.  We are hopeful that this will change in time, however, so we are excited to see this next release from Huawei – and, it will be sooner than you think with the Chinese launch set for the end of July.</p>
<ol start=\"4\">
<li>
<h2><strong>The New Samsung Galaxy Fan Edition Range</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The first of the FE series was launched by Samsung in 2020 and means ‘fan edition’. This range of the Samsung Galaxy is therefore supposed to encompass everything that the Galaxy S fans want and love about their phones – but at a reasonable price and Samsung has not included all the more ‘premium’ features of the mainstream Galaxy S series.</p>
<p>Back for 2021 with the second in the series, the new version of the FE is expected to launch in August alongside other new products. It is expected to take some influence in terms of design from the Galaxy S21, but with some slight difference in appearance. It will be pretty similar in terms of specification but do expect it to cost a little less than the S21, as with its predecessor.</p>
<ol start=\"5\">
<li>
<h2><strong>OnePlus 9T</strong></h2>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Following the release of the OnePlus 9, we are expecting a further release from the company this year – the OnePlus 9T. Rather than a completely new phone – we are expecting the 9T to be an upgraded version of its predecessor.</p>
<p>There isn’t much known about this phone yet – but we are hoping to see this release later in the year towards the autumn/winter.</p>
<p>We hope you are as excited about these new releases as we are, whilst we only know rumours at this stage – there are definitely rumours to get excited about. And if you really can’t wait, you can take a look at our <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/cheapest-total-cost-mobiles\">current deals</a>.</p>
