										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Looking to brighten up your life? We’ve got just the phone for you! Apple have announced at their ‘Spring Loaded’ event this week that a purple (yes, purple!) <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12 Purple</a> is set to become available, adding to the array of existing colours already on offer since the launch of their latest smartphone last October.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The event was staged virtually, as was also the case last year, but that didn’t stop the tech giant from sharing its intriguing new innovations with the rest of the world in their own unique way.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12 Purple</a> has been a huge hit with customers, and this new model can be yours for the exact same price as the rest of its kind, meaning you don’t have to worry about paying any extra to add a bit of purple to your purse or pocket.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Sounds great! When can I get my hands on one?</b></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The plush purple <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12 Purple</a>, also available on the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-mini-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12 Mini Purple</a>, launched this Friday 23</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">rd</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> April 2021 for pre-order from 1pm UK time and you can get yours </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">right here on the Fonehouse site </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">(insert link). It will be officially released seven days later on Friday 30</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">th</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> April 2021 to all customers who have pre-ordered, and we will begin shipping devices on this date, so act fast to grab yours in time for those early summer barbecues, pub garden drinks and sunny days out with your friends and family.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It’s the most popular smartphone in the world for good reason, and the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12</a> family has an over 99% customer satisfaction rate thanks mostly to its durable design and immersive display. Big things are expected of the new release, with Apple’s senior vice president of Worldwide Marketing, Greg Joswiak, commenting that “the new purple finish, just in time for spring, adds another bright and fun option to the lineup, and we think customers are going to love it.”</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h3><i>\&#8221;Apple always create demand. This device is no different. It’s powerful and bold. Every tweak and change Apple introduce is always popular, this new colour looks brilliant, our customers will be after it – as will my wife!\&#8221;</i> – Michael (Store Manager), Fonehouse Belfast</h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p><b>Why purple? Why not!</b></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple are known for their bright and vibrant finishes and this new purple design joins a snazzy list of fun options in what is an already colourful listing. It contains a range of fantastic features such as an advanced dual-camera system that delivers powerful computational photography and the highest-quality video in a smartphone, expansive edge-to-edge Super Retina XDR displays with OLED for an enhanced, brighter look and a Ceramic Shield front cover which provides the biggest jump in durability ever on an iPhone.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">All of this compliments the stunning flat-edge aluminum feel, perfectly colour-matched to the precision-milled black glass and more immersive viewing experience, not to mention its high-powered wireless charging with MagSafe and an all-new ecosystem of accessories that can be easily attached.</span></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="iPhone 12 - Now in Purple" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eFbA9M8g6FE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p><b>Throwing it back</b></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Its launch was unveiled at the same time as new brightly iMac computers, available in a rainbow of seven different shades, as Apple add a splash of colour to their collection of marketing-leading devices. The promotional video used to announce the new purple products provided a throwback to earlier purple iMac variations and expressed ‘delicious like candy’ messaging which alluded to Willy Wonka and the famous purple factory the character owned and colourful clothing he’s often associated with.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In a moment when people are constantly looking back to nostalgic periods from time gone by, Apple have really hit the ‘sweet spot’ with their new purple finish which just exudes positive vibes and vibrancy – and when do we ever not need some of that!</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What else makes the purple iPhone 12 so good?</b></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Well, where do we start! The durable, elevated, design and immersive display is as beautiful as it is practical, not to mention that the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-mini-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12 Mini purple</a> is the smallest 5G smartphone in the world, packing intelligent technology into a handy, compact size.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Watching videos or browsing through photos on the go? The immersive HDR viewing experience is perfect for high-definition video and images with enhanced detail and both models have nearly double the peak brightness of the iPhone 11 – which combined with the new purple finish makes for a delightfully colourful smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With an industry-leading IP68 rating for water resistance, you can rest easy knowing your device is protected against everyday spills, up to 6 meters and for up to 30 minutes.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Not only that, the Ultra Wide camera and a new Wide camera provides 27% more light for incredible video and photo-taking and ensures brighter pictures and better contrast for images taken in low-light settings with Night mode. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Order yours with Fonehouse today</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> (insert link) and you can benefit from an end-to-end Dolby Vision experience (the first and only device to provide such a thing), and shoot cinema-grade videos natively on your iPhone.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With playback on the <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12 Purple</a>  now more realistic than ever before thanks to the Super Retina XDR display, both models boast improved cinematic video stabilisation and true-to-life selfie videos with Dolby Vision. Other features include longer exposure times for sharper videos, better light trails and smoother exposure in low-light scenarios.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Buy today &amp; do your bit for the environment</b></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Did you know that <a href="https://www.fonehouse.co.uk/mobile-phone-deals/iphone-12-5g-64gb-purple\">iPhone 12</a> models are made of 100% recycled rare earth elements in all magnets? This includes the camera, Taptic Engine and MagSafe, as well as Apple’s MagSafe accessories, whilst the power adaptor and EarPods have also been removed from packaging which further reduces carbon emissions and avoids the use and mining of precious materials, allowing for 70% more boxes to be shipped on pallet.</span></p>
<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In total, this has cut over two million metric tons of carbon emissions each year which, for context, is similar to taking not far off 450,000 cars from the road annually. So not only can you get your hands on a vivacious new purple-coloured phone, but you can also do your bit for the greater good of the planet.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<h2><strong><i>\&#8221;We have already started to receive interest in the new iPhone 12, no changes to the core device but it’s a striking new colour and the fashionistas are keen!\&#8221; </i>– </strong>David (Store Manager), Fonehouse Wokingham</h2>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>So, you have just received your new pay monthly mobile phone and you’re wondering how you get your hands on the cashback deal included. Easy! We’ve put together a simple guide to help you stay on top of your redemption cashback claims. You’ll want to make sure you take it all in as much as possible to get the largest savings available.</p>
<h2>Claiming Cashback</h2>
<p>It’s super simple to claim your cashback. There aren’t too many steps, you just need to understand when to claim. All that’s required to submit a cashback claim is your network bill and your Fonehouse account. The first email you receive from us will be a validation link to this account. Click this as soon as you receive it and set a password for your new Fonehouse account. When you want to claim cashback, just login into your account and click the button titled ‘Claim Cashback’ in the bottom left corner.</p>
<p>You’ll see a cashback form appear on screen. This asks for your order number, name. email address, date of birth, network, telephone number and bill date. You’ll also need to include a PDF download of your relevant bill, make sure you keep reading to find out which dates these are. All you need to do is enter the details given when you placed the order and submit your claim. You’ll get an email shortly confirming your claim has been submitted successfully and our finance team will get to processing it within 14 working days.</p>
<p>If you have any issues when trying to claim, you will need to contact customer services who will be able to help rectify the problems. Send an email to <a href="mailto:support@fonehouse.co.uk">support@fonehouse.co.uk</a> with your PDF bill attached and all the details needed on the claim form. It’s important you do this last step in case it’s a simple fix with changing some details that you’re entering.</p>
<h2>12 Month Redemption Cashback Claim Dates</h2>
<p>Depending on which contract you have taken out, your claim dates may differ slightly. One thing that doesn’t change at all is how the cashback is claimed. Please read the above section for information into how to claim. You will only have a SIM only 12 month contract, we don’t currently offer this length for handset plans. The shorter the contract, the higher the price is. We like to ensure that our deals are as affordable as possible to keep our customers happy.</p>
<p>Redemption cashback has to be claimed for in 5 equal instalments. For anyone on a 12 month contract, you will need to submit your PDF network bill in billing months 3, 5, 7, 9 and 12. You must submit a claim within 60 days of receiving the bill or you risk missing out on the claim. We do suggest putting a reminder in your phone so that you’re able to keep up with these savings. If you claim outside of this 60 day period then you risk not having payment of cashback.</p>
<p>Once you have successfully submitted your claim, you will receive an email letting you know it will be processed. The Fonehouse finance team will process the submitted claim within 14 working days and pay the instalment within 21 working days if accepted.</p>
<h2>18 &amp; 24 Month Redemption Cashback Claim Dates</h2>
<p>Claiming for cashback on an 18 or 24 month plan is almost exactly the same as claiming on a 12 month plan. The only difference is when you claim for the payments. Just like 12 month plans, you won’t find an 18 month handset plan. This is for the same reason, to ensure our deals stay affordable. There are both 18 and 24 month SIM only plans. If you have either of these contracts, then this is when you need to claim your cashback.</p>
<p>All redemption cashback is paid in 5 equal instalments. You don’t get paid any more for the first claim, we make sure every single claim is the same amount throughout. By the end of the 5 claims, you should have the full balance, as long as all submissions were successful. For anyone on an 18 or 24 month plan, you will need to claim for your cashback in billing months 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18. Make sure that you successfully submit your claim within the 60 day period or the cashback will not be paid. Again, we do suggest you set a reminder in your phone so you never miss the savings.</p>
<p>You will receive an email, letting you know that your submission has been received. Within 14 days, the Fonehouse finance team will process the claim. If accepted, they will pay the instalment via BACS to the bank account given on your order within 21 days. It’s important to let us know of any detail changes so we can avoid delays.</p>
<h2>Reasons for rejection</h2>
<p>Any claim will be rejected if it\&#8217;s submitted outside of the 60 day period. There is no chance for this to be contested. We suggest that customers submit their bills as soon as they receive them from the network in order to avoid this issue. It also gives you a lot more time to solve any other potential issues that arise.</p>
<p>We only pay cashback to customers who are up to date with their network bills. If you are behind on bills, we cannot pay you until it is resolved. Customers who have been disconnected from their network will have orders and cashback cancelled. You will need to have a new, completed order with cashback if you want to continue.</p>
<p>We set our cashback specific to the deals we have on our website. When these deals are changed by the customer or the network, the cashback is affected. We highly suggest not changing your tariff if you want to receive the cashback extra as we will be forced to withdraw any cashback offers if this happens. If you are unsure of any changes to your contract, please contact Fonehouse directly.</p>
<p>When you’re submitting your cashback form, you’ll be asked for a few details. If these do not match what we hold on your order, the cashback claim will be rejected. It’s super easy to avoid this issue as you can update your details with Fonehouse directly. If you need to change anything, simply get in contact with us and we can help.</p>
<p>Cashback can also be rejected if the wrong bill is submitted. As long as you follow the above cashback claim dates, the bill will be correct. Just double check that the bill date you enter on the form matches the date shown on the network bill.</p>
<h2>Automatic Cashback</h2>
<p>You may notice that we have two different forms of cashback on our website. These are redemption and automatic cashback. You’ll find a huge range of both these extras however, automatic cashback is a little different. It doesn’t allow for as high savings as redemption cashback does however, it requires no claiming whatsoever. It’s one lump sum that we will pay directly to the bank account on your order. After 90 days, our finance team will check that you’re up to date with network bills and process the payment. It’s important to let us know of any changes to your details before this period to avoid delays.</p>
<p>Cashback really is as simple a couple clicks and a reminder. If there are problems with your cashback, you’ll receive an email to let you know within 14 days. If you have any other questions, our customer service team is on hand to answer them. You can find hundreds of <a href="mailto:support@fonehouse.co.uk">amazing cashback deals</a> over on our website.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most important things when buying a new pay monthly mobile phone contract is definitely keeping your mobile number. All your friends, family and business partners have your number and need to keep in contact with you. It can seem like too much hassle changing your number completely.</p>
<p>There are two things that help when porting numbers; a PAC and a STAC.</p>
<h2>What is a PAC?</h2>
<p>A PAC is a 9-character code, in the format ‘ABC123456’, which allowed you to move your current mobile number over to your new mobile phone contract. You can only use a PAC when you move from your current network to a new network.<br />
Getting hold of your PAC has never been so simple. All you have to do is text the work ‘PAC’ to 65075. You’ll get a text back almost instantly with your transfer code. Enter this into the checkout and we’ll do the rest for you!</p>
<h2>What is a STAC?</h2>
<p>A STAC comes in the format ‘123456ABC’, that allows you to cancel your previous contract and take a new number. Make sure you provide the right code as you will lose your number! To get hold of a STAC by texting ‘STAC’ to 75075.</p>
<p>You can’t use this code to stay within your current network, only change networks. It will take no more than 60 seconds for you to receive the STAC via text. Give us the STAC when you place your order and we’ll sort everything else.</p>
<h2>Everything Else you Need to Know</h2>
<p>Your mobile number will not port over the weekend! Network teams are a lot smaller during the weekend so you may have to be patient. Your old contract won\&#8217;t be cut off until you put the new SIM card into your phone so you won\&#8217;t lose contact.</p>
<p>Once you order has been dispatch and connected, it will take up to 48 hours to update your number. We will pass your PAC/STAC over to your new network and have your mobile number automatically transferred to the new pay monthly contract. If you number hasn’t ported over after 48 hours of having your new SIM in your new mobile phone, try restarting the phone. If this still doesn’t work, contact customer services for further advice. Once your mobile number has ported over to your new contract, your old contract will be cancelled down. You do not need to call anyone to have this actioned.</p>
<h2>Be Careful</h2>
<p>You have only got 30 days before your code expires so make sure you are certain which pay monthly mobile phone contract you would like before texting the above numbers. If your code expires before you use it, you will need to get hold of the code again in the same way. You also risk being charged by your previous provider as the contract won’t have cancelled yet.</p>
<p>You don’t have to use a PAC or a STAC when you place your order with us. If no code is provided at the checkout, your previous contract will stay active, you will have a new number and you may be charged for your old contract as well as your new contract.<br />
You cannot transfer or cancel your number if you are still within contract. You will be asked to pay an early termination fee should you try.</p>
<p>If the number you are trying to keep is with the same network your new contract is on, we will give you a new number. You will have to discuss with the network as to how you can transfer your old mobile number across.</p>
<p>Who would have thought that keeping your number would be that simple? Any more questions you may have regarding number porting can be answered <a href="https://www.smoothswitch.co.uk/\">here</a>.</p>
